you know , one of the big <unk> in the travel and one of the reasons is to get together with the people who still remember the old days , who still feel their past in the wind , putting them on the rain of the rain in the plants .
just knowing that <unk> still travel beyond the milky way , or the importance of reality , the oldest of the russians are still full of meaning , or that , in the himalayas , still <unk> the breath of the <unk> , means to call the central expansion of conflict into memory , which is the idea that the world in which we live in , not in absolute sense , but only as a model of reality , as a consequence of a group of certain possibilities that will succeed our opportunity to succeed before many generations .
and of course , we share all the same <unk> .
we all born . we bring children to the world .
we go through <unk> .
we need to deal with the <unk> <unk> by death , and so we shouldn &apos;t surprise that we all sing , dance and art and art .
but interesting , the unique <unk> of the <unk> , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
and it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s going to be about <unk> in the forests of <unk> , or the <unk> in haiti , or the <unk> in haiti , or the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> in the 1960s , or a <unk> in the middle of the sahara . this is happened to the colleague i flew in the desert for a month ago , or even a <unk> on the edge of the <unk> , everest , the <unk> of the world .
all these people are teaching us that there are other <unk> , other ways , other ways of being on earth .
and this is a notion that , if you think about it , can only bring to hope .
together , the <unk> cultures in the world is a network of <unk> and <unk> life , which is as important to earth , which is as important as biological <unk> that you know as biosphere .
you can think of this cultural <unk> as a <unk> . <unk> can be seen as the <unk> of all the thoughts and dreams , myths ideas and <unk> that have been imagination by the human imagination since the beginning of consciousness .
<unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we are as amazing <unk> species .
and just as the biosphere was strong , it happened with the <unk> -- just greater speed .
not a biologist would say , for example , that 50 percent or more of all kinds of species are just in front of the extinction , because it &apos;s just not true , and yet , this -- the most interesting thing in the field of biological diversity -- is hardly what we know as <unk> <unk> in the field of cultural diversity .
and the key part of that is the extinction of languages .
when any of you in this room were born on the earth , 6,000 languages were spoken .
now , language is not just the <unk> , or a series of <unk> .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means to find the soul of a certain culture access to the physical world .
every language is like a <unk> forest of the mind , an event , an idea , an ecosystem , ecosystem possibilities .
and from these 6,000 languages today , as we sit here in monterey , half are no longer in the ears of children .
they won &apos;t be taught more . that means when nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be more powerful than being out of the silence , one of the last <unk> people who speak your language , no way to have the wisdom of ancestors , or hope to expect hope ?
and yet , this horrible thing actually happened somewhere anywhere on earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , one of the older men and takes the last half of a old language to the grave .
and i know some of you will say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t the world a better place if we all talk about language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be <unk> . let &apos;s be <unk> .
let &apos;s be <unk> . &quot;
and then you suddenly realize how it would be if you couldn &apos;t talk your own language .
so today , i would like to take you on a journey through the <unk> , a short journey through the <unk> to try and make them understand what actually lost .
now , there are some of us that seem to forget that when i say , &quot; different ways of being , &quot; really different possibilities of my own .
take the example of this child , for example , in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the <unk> , believe that they <unk> the <unk> from the east from sacred snakes .
this is a people that doesn &apos;t smell between the colors blue and green , because the <unk> forest that people depend on .
they have a profound language , and it &apos;s called a <unk> <unk> : you must marry somebody else language .
all of this in the <unk> past . the most exciting thing about these big houses in which are six or seven languages is that you never hear someone who learns language .
you just hear and start talking .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the <unk> , the most amazing people , the first year in 1998 , was born .
in 2008 , five <unk> contact contact and made a <unk> mistake .
they took pictures of the air out of the air , which was what we were going to consider as a clever gesture , and what we would do with is that these people had never seen anything else in their lives .
and she took this photographs from the sun , tried to see behind the face , or seeing the character , didn &apos;t find anything and <unk> that this was the <unk> of the devil , and he killed the five <unk> .
but the <unk> don &apos;t just kill <unk> .
they <unk> each other .
eighty percent of the deaths were <unk> by <unk> .
we looked back at eight generations , and found two cases of a natural death , and when we gave people a little bit about it , they gave them that one of the people were so old that he died because of his age , and he killed him anyway .
but at the same time , they had a clear story of the forest , which was amazing .
they were able to smell the secrets of an animal from 40 steps of distance , and determine what the <unk> of that one .
and in the early days , i got a really amazing job when my professor at harvard asked whether i was interested in haiti to go to haiti and find the secret societies that were used to <unk> the foundation of <unk> and <unk> and the poison that was used to make <unk> .
so to make sense of that kind of sense of mind , i had to believe something about this remarkable belief of knowledge and <unk> .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex <unk> .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i were to ask you , what would you say ?
<unk> , islam , <unk> , <unk> , whatever .
a continent is always left , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious belief , of course . of course there was one and <unk> , and it &apos;s just the result of this very , very , very , very , very common religious idea , which is during the simplest <unk> of <unk> .
but what &apos;s interesting about <unk> is that living relationship between living and dead .
the living <unk> the minds .
the minds can be <unk> by under the great water , answers to the rhythm of the dance to <unk> the soul of living , so the <unk> for a brief second moment becomes god .
<unk> would like to say , &quot; your white goes to church and talk about god .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to get away from the mind . how can you get damage ?
you can see this amazing <unk> : <unk> in a <unk> <unk> , <unk> coal , an amazing <unk> of the ability of the mind to influence the body so that this <unk> when it becomes a state of extreme <unk> .
now , of all the people i met were the <unk> from the sierra <unk> de <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> .
according to the old <unk> civilization , the <unk> <unk> of mexico , and as a result , this people moved into a <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is above the <unk> coast .
in a <unk> continent , these people were the only ones that were never killed by the <unk> .
up to today &apos;s day , they are <unk> by a <unk> . the education is very extraordinary .
the young people are separated by their families at the age of three and four years from their families , and in a <unk> world of <unk> , in <unk> <unk> on the <unk> for 18 years . two days of the last nine years , followed by the way , the nine months of pregnancy she spent in the lap of her mother , spend now in the lap of the great mother .
and during that whole period , they become culturally in the values of their society , values that claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic cosmic -- or we could say , &quot; we might say , &quot; balance , balance . &quot;
by the end of this amazing , you &apos;re going to suddenly take out of that amazing beautiful landscape for the first time in your life , at the age of 18 , you see an <unk> , and in this particular moment of consciousness &apos;s consciousness , when the sun starts to slow down on the side of the amazing beautiful landscape , suddenly you &apos;ve learned in terms of the amazing beautiful landscape , and the shepherd starts back and says , &quot; you see ? it &apos;s really how i told you .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
whenever we think about <unk> and landscape , we <unk> either <unk> and the old <unk> of the <unk> wild , which is a <unk> thought , or on the other hand , and say , these people are more connected to nature than we are .
so , <unk> are not <unk> , they &apos;re still being <unk> by the <unk> .
there &apos;s not a lot of place for that in the <unk> <unk> of tibet or the cold <unk> of tibet , but yet , through time and ritual , a <unk> <unk> of the earth , which is not based on the idea of being aware of their conscious , but on a far more profound intuition , the idea that the earth can only exist because it is in the human consciousness .
well , what does that mean ?
it means that a little kid from the <unk> that believe that the mountain is a <unk> , or your destiny , will determine a whole other relationship , and a different relationship with that resource , or that place , as a little child in montana , which thinks that a mountain is a bunch of rocks that can be eaten .
whether he &apos;s a <unk> or a bunch of <unk> , is <unk> .
the interesting is the metaphor that defined the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of <unk> engineers and believed that these forests are there to be <unk> .
that made me another human being , as my friends among the <unk> who believe that this forests of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> are the <unk> of the world who live at the <unk> of the world , that they would participate in their <unk> .
now , when you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . like this plant here .
it &apos;s a picture i just took last april in the amazon of the amazon .
this is <unk> , which many of you have heard of , the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> .
what &apos;s fascinating so fascinating is not just the most powerful potential of this <unk> , but of interaction . it &apos;s actually made out of two different sources . on one hand , there &apos;s this <unk> <unk> , which is a series of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , slightly <unk> , <unk> . these <unk> alone is a bit like a blue <unk> smoke on your consciousness , but it &apos;s going to <unk> with the leaves of a <unk> from the family of <unk> with the name of <unk> <unk> .
this plant contains some very strong <unk> that are very similar to the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
if you &apos;ve seen the <unk> , as you &apos;ve seen this stuff , this substance that you create with different types of forms also .
so this particular thing is about to become kind of like a <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> , and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not producing reality , it &apos;s the resolution of reality .
i even met with my professor , richard evan <unk> , who &apos;s the man who <unk> the <unk> <unk> with the discovery of magic mushrooms in mexico in the <unk> years , and i realized that you couldn &apos;t be able to <unk> this <unk> , because at the moment in which you feel the impact , you &apos;re not there to know anymore .
but the thing about <unk> is that they can &apos;t be <unk> , because they are , of course , in the human gut , of course , with the name of <unk> .
you can only get a bunch of chemicals in connection with a few other chemicals that are called mao .
now the fascinating thing is that the <unk> , which are in <unk> , are <unk> of exactly the way that &apos;s necessary to <unk> the <unk> . ask yourself .
how can these people come from a <unk> plant plants that can &apos;t find these two kinds of <unk> plants that , if , in this way , combine some kind of <unk> version that the whole larger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great <unk> , trial and error , which turned out to be an authentic thing .
but when you ask them , they say , &quot; the plant talks to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the <unk> , have 17 varieties of <unk> , which you all see at large distance in the forest , which are kind of like this .
and then you ask them how to go around and say , &quot; i thought you &apos;re doing some plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out you can take each of the 17 variations in surfaces and sing them into a different <unk> .
now , this brings you not a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> .
now , the problem with the problem is that even those of us who have <unk> for the difficult conditions of the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> , but somehow in the past , as the real world , our world , our <unk> .
so , the fact is , you remember the 20th century , in 300 years , not for its wars or technical innovation , but rather than a era where we were <unk> , and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on earth are either active , so the problem is not change .
all cultures have always been involved in dance with new <unk> .
and the problem is not the technology itself .
the <unk> didn &apos;t listen to being less than strangers , and they &apos;re not less <unk> than americans , when they horse horse and <unk> tasks .
not change and technology , the integrity of <unk> . it &apos;s power . the ordinary face of leadership .
and wherever you look around the world , you &apos;ll discover that these cultures are not <unk> . these are dynamic living peoples that are being prepared by political forces , who are willing to fill up their capacity with <unk> <unk> that they have in the forest , or in the case of the <unk> , where they can see that even half of the flow is <unk> .
or when we go to the mountains of tibet , where i study a lot of research , you will see the normal face of political ocean .
you know , the genocide , the <unk> extinction of people , is generally convicted , but the <unk> , the destruction of the lifestyle of people , not just babbage , but generally and <unk> as part of a <unk> .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering of suffering if you haven &apos;t seen it at <unk> level .
i went back with a young fellow fellow miles of <unk> in <unk> <unk> , and only when i went to <unk> , i saw the face behind the statistics of whom you hear about it , and i would hear the most sacred <unk> that were turned into <unk> and <unk> . 1.2 million people who were born during the cultural revolution .
the father of this young <unk> was identified as a captain of the <unk> lama .
that meant that it was killed during the chinese hemisphere immediately .
his uncle came back to the diaspora that people brought to nepal .
his mother turned out to be an expert -- for the crime of crime .
he was in prison at age two years to hide under her <unk> , because she couldn &apos;t live with him .
the sister who did this <unk> , was brought into a <unk> .
and one day , she landed out on a <unk> , and she had to run it for seven years , and she had to run it for seven years .
the suffering of suffering can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of people is a little <unk> .
and at the end , we &apos;re really in front of a choice . do we want to live in a <unk> world or in a <unk> world of diversity ?
margaret <unk> , the great philosopher said before she died that it was their greatest fear , that as we move towards a <unk> , we can move around the entire range of human imagination , not just to see the entire range of human imagination , but that one day we wake up from a dream , and forget that there were any other possibilities .
and it &apos;s unlikely to think that our species have existed for millennia years .
the most exciting revolution that brought us agriculture , and at this moment , the <unk> of <unk> , the poetry of <unk> through the <unk> of <unk> and hierarchy , <unk> and <unk> -- found only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this extraordinary story tells me not that we all have the answers to the challenges that we face .
if we ask these <unk> to the importance of the human question , you answer with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to be the possibility of being able to be able to do what we are , human consciousness , who are aware of the importance that all humans and gardens can create a room to be <unk> , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a picture i took at the northern end of the <unk> , when i went to the <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the u.s. government is not always very good with the inuit and during the <unk> years of the <unk> of ours , they were forced to pull into mexico .
the grandfather &apos;s grandfather &apos;s grandfather &apos;s grandfather .
the family , the fear of his life , took him all the weapons and all tools .
now you have to know that there are no fear of the cold , they used it to their benefit .
the <unk> of their <unk> were originally made of fish .
the grandfather &apos;s grandfather wasn &apos;t a <unk> night or <unk> storm .
he <unk> out , he pulled out his pants out of <unk> and <unk> his hand , and as the fishermen started <unk> , he <unk> them into the form of a classroom .
he <unk> on the side of the <unk> , and when it was completely frozen , he <unk> a dog .
he <unk> the dog and he grabs a <unk> , took the skeleton of the dog , and he was wearing a <unk> , <unk> another dog and <unk> over the <unk> with the <unk> .
you can &apos;t do anything like this .
and this is a symbol of the resistance of the inuit and all the world &apos;s leaders .
the u.s. government gave the 2008 control in april of 1999 , which is bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new home and it &apos;s called <unk> .
it &apos;s an independent area . they all control <unk> .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state that can look for its own people .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are gone to this distant goals of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not removed at all .
you &apos;re the <unk> of somebody .
they represent parts of human imagination that live in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children will become part of the hope of hope .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that we think politicians never achieve anything .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> is not <unk> , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world -- our website has 35 million <unk> every month .
<unk> nations send our <unk> .
our portraits are read by millions .
and we do a series of travel into the <unk> , where we take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that it can contribute from the subject to our shared well-being .
thank you .
what i first like to show you , as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we &apos;ve got microsoft as a part of a classroom before just a year ago . this is <unk> , and it &apos;s a environment where you either can deal with local amounts of visual data .
we see a lot , a lot of thousands of digital photographs here , which allows you to be able to make <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , in any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we look at how big these worms are , or how big the images are .
most of you are digital images of a camera , but this one , for example , is a scan of <unk> , and it &apos;s in one area of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t matter , because the only thing that the performance of a system like this can be is the number of things on your screen at each moment . it &apos;s also a very unique architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> &apos;s house . each gram is a chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really a text and not a picture , we can do something like this , to really show that this is a real representation of <unk> and not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
and that gives you the pleasure and the good experience to read a real <unk> of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with several scales .
we also did something on the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we designed a false display with very high <unk> that &apos;s much higher than a normal display , and we have additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this cars , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical design .
and this really creates these ideas , this limits for the available place on the screen .
we hope that that doesn &apos;t mean <unk> and others means that it shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
of course , the code is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time , except to say that we &apos;re going to be involved in this area .
but these are all roads in the <unk> .
<unk> above the <unk> picture of nasa .
now let &apos;s do something else .
now this is live live on the internet . you can <unk> .
this is a project called <unk> , which really connects two different technologies .
one is <unk> , and the other is a very good research on <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of the university , under steve <unk> at <unk> .
and rick <unk> was done by microsoft research . a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s produced by <unk> .
you can see that if we create these kinds of views where we can break through images and make this experience of <unk> .
but the <unk> of images is in fact meaning .
the <unk> have taken these pictures together to put them in the real space , in which these images that have been made all near the <unk> <unk> in the canadian <unk> , you &apos;re looking at the elements of <unk> slides or <unk> <unk> , and these things were all in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know if i have time to show you other environments .
there are those who are much more comfortable .
and i &apos;d like to show you just one of the most amazing footage of noah , and this is from a early prototype that we &apos;ve been working on for the first time to show you what i think is really the fundamental behind this technology , which is <unk> , and this is not so obvious when you look at environments that we have on the website .
we had to worry about the lawyers .
this is a <unk> of the <unk> lady who was discovered in the computer with pictures of flickr . give them <unk> lady in flickr , and they will get pictures of men in toronto and on the <unk> etc . each of these <unk> <unk> represents a picture that was discovered to this model .
so this is all <unk> , and you all stand in relation to this way .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i was going to work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the <unk> here .
and i guess you can see that this is a lot of different types of cameras : everything is done from <unk> to professional <unk> , which is quite large number of you that have been <unk> in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;m going to find some of the strange .
many of you are surrounded by faces and so on .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here they are .
this is actually a poster by <unk> lady who was shot right .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with social environment , and now we &apos;re going to collect data from all around -- from the entire collective memory of what , what is the earth -- and everything is connected .
all of these photographs become connected , and it becomes something bigger than the sum of parts .
you get a model that comes out of all the earth .
consider this as the <unk> of work from stephen <unk> to virtual earth .
and this is something that happens by the complexity that people use it , and it &apos;s using the benefit for the user to use it .
your own photos are associated with a <unk> that has a different person .
if someone has done it , and all of these sacred have <unk> and who they all are , my photograph is going to suddenly be my photograph by the <unk> , suddenly , of all of this data , and i can use it as a way to go into this room , into this room , into these <unk> , into these <unk> that are using a kind of <unk> social experience with the use of others .
and of course , according to all of that , the vast rich virtual models of every interesting part of the planet , which is not just by <unk> or <unk> and so forth , but by collective memory .
thank you .
so , do i understand right ? your software enables you that at some point , within the next years , all images that are used by somebody in the world will be connected to each other ?
yeah . it doesn &apos;t make anything else .
if you want to create it between the pictures .
and she does this because of the course in the images .
and this is really exciting when you think of the <unk> information that many of these images have .
like , if you do a <unk> for pictures , where you type sentences , and the text of the website contains a lot of information about what the picture is .
but what about the picture of all your images ?
and then the amount of <unk> and the amount that makes it really enormous . it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
<unk> , that &apos;s really incredible . thank you very much .
thank you very much .
so i &apos;m going to tell you a few things from my book that i hope in terms of other things you &apos;ve heard already , and i &apos;m going to try to create some connections if you haven &apos;t noticed these .
i want to start with what i call &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all western societies .
the official <unk> works like this : if our goal is to protect the origins of our citizens , it &apos;s all about changing the freedom of the individual .
the reason for this is that freedom is good in itself , valuable , sense , a <unk> assumption for human beings .
when people have freedom , each of us is each of us to do things that affect our personal government and nobody for us .
the path to defend is choice .
the more choices have the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more they have more choices .
this is , i think , so deep in our water , that it would never come to question .
and it &apos;s deep in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what modern progress allows us to do .
this is my supermarket . no big one .
i just want to just briefly say a little bit about <unk> .
there are <unk> <unk> in my supermarket , if you can &apos;t <unk> the 10 different extra <unk> and 12 <unk> that you could buy to make a large number of your <unk> <unk> , in the case that no one &apos;s in the store for you .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then you go to the <unk> store around a <unk> -- speaker , <unk> , a <unk> , radio , <unk> . and in that one electronics , there &apos;s so many <unk> .
we can make millions of different <unk> resources from the components that are offered in this store .
you have to admit that this is a great choice .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , because you could put every telephone that you wanted to , as long as it came to bell bell .
you have your phone . you didn &apos;t bought it .
a consequence of it was that the telephone was never broken .
these days are over .
we now have almost an infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite one is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and if you haven &apos;t seen this in your business , you can be sure that you will soon .
and what it does is it makes people go into business and ask that question .
now , you know what the answer to that question is ?
the answer is no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life that are much more valuable than buying objects , the same explosion of choice .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor , and the doctor says , we could make a , or we could make b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has this benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
the doctor says a , has these benefits and risks and b has these benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if i were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy , &quot; which sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift in the burden of responsibility for the meeting of someone who knows something -- including the doctor -- to somebody who doesn &apos;t know anything and bad sick , and therefore , therefore , is a decision to make a decision -- is the patient .
there &apos;s a tremendous marketing for <unk> drugs for people like you and me who , if you think about it , doesn &apos;t make sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they get around us if we can &apos;t buy ?
and the answer is , you expect us to kill the doctor in the next morning and ask for a change .
something as complex as our identity is now a question of choice as this slide is supposed to show .
we don &apos;t see identity , we invent them .
and so we often invent the way we want .
that means that every day when you wake up the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the <unk> was that almost everybody had one , and they could as fast as they could , and then they could get kids as fast as they could .
the only true choice was , &quot; who , not when , and not what they did .
today , it &apos;s all easy .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i did earlier .
and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and they &apos;re not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because it &apos;s busy with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i marry now ?
should i marry later ? should i have children , or just career ? &quot;
they &apos;re all <unk> questions .
and you &apos;ll answer these questions regardless of whether that means all the tasks that i &apos;m going to leave you with and not have a good note in my class .
and indeed , they should . these are important questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl did , with the technology that allows us to work every minute every day on the planet -- to the <unk> hotel .
by the way , there &apos;s a corner i &apos;m not going to tell you about where the <unk> works .
i &apos;m not going to tell you about it because i want to use it .
so what it means , this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of making decisions , again and again and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can play our kids playing games , and we have our mobile phone on one hip , and our relatives to others , and our laptop probably on our lap .
and even if you &apos;re all hungry , every minute in which we asked our child at the end of a <unk> , we ask ourselves , &quot; should i take this call ?
should i answer that email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question no , no , it &apos;s certainly the experience of their child &apos;s experience very different than it would have been .
wherever we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world in which we lived looked like this .
i want to say there were a few choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world in which we live now looks like this .
and the question is , are the good or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what good is , so what &apos;s bad about it .
all of these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
a effect , <unk> way , is that he instead of free them .
with so many options you can choose , it &apos;s very difficult to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another <unk> example , a study of investment in volunteers .
a handful of mine had access to <unk> <unk> , the giant <unk> of about a million dollars and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what they found was 10 percent of the residents , took it by two percent .
they provide 50 percent <unk> -- 10 percent less employees than if they only offer five . why ?
because there are 50 <unk> that are available to choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide what you want to choose it to tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course never come .
do you understand that it &apos;s not just that people have to eat <unk> , when they go to the war , because they don &apos;t have enough money to fund , it means to make the decisions so hard that they miss large <unk> of their own .
by the way , they give up to 5,000 u.s. dollars a year on the <unk> that would have been happy to raise their contribution .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
you want to make the decision really right if it &apos;s for everyone , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong <unk> for vote , or even the wrong <unk> .
so that &apos;s the effect . the other effect is that even if we make the paralysis and make a decision , we end less happy with the outcome of choice than if we had the opportunity to choose between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is driven by the big choice of different <unk> if they buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , which is <unk> already ? it &apos;s just imagine that you could have hit a different decision that would have been better . and what happens is this visual <unk> alternative that makes you feel the decision , and it &apos;s very negative to the happiness that you have made from your computer , even if it was a good decision .
the more ways we have , the easier it &apos;s easier to have nothing to forget about it .
second , what economists call <unk> .
dan gilbert has made a big point in the morning by telling me how much the way we treat things depends on what we compare it .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternatives to think about it , it &apos;s just powerful properties of alternatives that they make , that makes them less happy with the alternatives they chose .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new york , i &apos;m sorry .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s some on the <unk> .
very expensive value .
beautiful beach . great day . they all have it for themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everyone in my <unk> neighborhood is gone .
i could go in front of my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks from the thought that he had the opportunity to have a great parking day over the day .
<unk> reduce the happiness we get through our choice , even if what we &apos;ve chosen is fantastic .
and the more ways there are choice , the more powerful properties of these choices are going to be in the <unk> .
here &apos;s another example .
now this cartoon makes some details .
he &apos;s making a statement about it now , and maybe doing things slowly .
but one more important point he &apos;s doing : always who choose for one thing , don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things may have many powerful properties , and it &apos;s going to do what they &apos;re going to do less .
third : <unk> of expectations .
and this struck me when i wanted my jeans .
i wear feet , almost all the time .
and there was just a time in which there was only a piece of species , and they bought them , and they were bad , they were incredibly <unk> , and if they had long <unk> and often enough , they started to do &quot; ok . &quot;
so to buy new jeans after many years of the <unk> , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few jeans here , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the doctor said , &quot; do you want <unk> , easy <unk> or big ?
do you want <unk> or <unk> ? stone or <unk> ?
do you want to interact with holes ?
if you want far down far , <unk> , blah blah blah ... &quot; and so on .
my foot was down , and after i said to myself , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like the way it was the only way . &quot;
and he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour all of these sweet jeans , and i got the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best <unk> jeans i &apos;ve ever had .
i was better . all these feelings allowed me to have better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to explain to myself .
the reason why i felt worse was with all of these available possibilities , my expectations for what a good pair of jeans are going up .
i had very low expectations . i had no extra expectations when there was only one species .
when they came to 100 species , they felt perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so what i got is what i expected and what i expected , and what i was expected to do was compared to what i expected .
the add of opportunities to people &apos;s lives is to have the expectations that people have about how well they &apos;re going to be .
and that leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
no one in the world of <unk> knows this , because if you did , you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s here .
the truth is more like this .
the reason it used to be better than anything was worse than anything was worse than anything was worse , it was possible for people to make experiences that were very surprising .
now , in the world that we live in -- we &apos;ve got wealthy , <unk> citizens , with fear as adults -- the best thing you can ever hope are things as good as you expect .
they &apos;re never going to be comfortable because of their expectations , my expectations , <unk> .
the secret to <unk> -- that &apos;s what they all came from -- the secret to <unk> are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short <unk> moment -- that i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t <unk> .
but <unk> isn &apos;t always that bad thing .
ultimately , a consequence of the <unk> of a bad room , if there &apos;s one way to buy , is that if you &apos;re a magician , and you ask yourself why , who is responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what would you have to do ?
if hundreds of different kinds of devices are available , and you buy one of them who are there , and you ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : you .
they could have better do it .
with 100 different types of jeans in <unk> , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so when people make decisions , and even when the results of decisions are good , you feel disappointed about them .
clinical depression in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a <unk> -- not the only one , but one of the <unk> <unk> to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experienced the conditions because their standards are so high , and then , if you have to explain that experience , think about it .
and so the key thing is that we generally do better than we do , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official <unk> that we all think is right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that &apos;s better than none , but it doesn &apos;t follow the more choice than a choice .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed that point for a long time on the choice .
now , as a public question -- i &apos;m almost finished -- as a policy question about thinking about this , which is all of these choice in the developed societies , the material wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of them whose problem is not too big choice .
your problem is you have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about are a massive problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating , and so steve has talked to them yesterday about how this expensive and hard to do is not help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive decisions -- it &apos;s not easy that they don &apos;t help .
they actually hurt .
they worry about that .
if some of the things that people allow our society make decisions to the societies in which people would have little choice , not only would people improve lives , but our dignity would be improved .
economists call this a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is going to make sure it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all of these big choices give us .
in closing , please read this cartoon , and , a <unk> person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know anything possible in this <unk> . &quot;
<unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i first read it .
the more i thought about this , the more i got to the point that the fish knows something .
because the truth is , if you break the <unk> , you have no freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the <unk> , so it &apos;s all possible , reduce happiness .
they increase paralysis and reduce happiness .
everybody needs a <unk> .
this is almost <unk> security -- possibly for fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> being <unk> is a recipe for misery , and i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , thinking about human genome , and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point : we have this biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get the digital code into a new phase of biology by creating new life and build together .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something i think many biologists have tried to understand and look at different levels .
we &apos;ve tried a lot of techniques to <unk> it all the way .
we &apos;ve had nearly 20 years . when we sequenced the <unk> , we have evolved to change the world of biology to the digital world of biology .
now we &apos;re trying to ask if we can live life , or can we make new life out of this digital universe ?
this is the map of a little organism , <unk> <unk> , that can transform the smallest genome of a species that can transform itself in the lab , and we &apos;re trying to do that with a smaller genome .
we managed to get down to about a hundred genes by the 500 or something .
but if we look at these closely map , which is very simple , compared to ours . trust me , that &apos;s simple . but if we look at all of these genes that we can see one after another , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell .
so we decided it &apos;s the only way in front of this chromosome , which allows us to combine the individual components and to ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we get a chromosome ?
does it allow chemistry to create this really big molecules that was never done before ?
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is so <unk> chemical material .
our steps at the <unk> of life were exponentially .
now , our ability to write genetic code has changed very slowly , but it &apos;s still evolving , and our final point is now on an exponential curve .
we started with this 15 years ago .
it actually took a couple of years ago with a <unk> article before we did the first experiments .
it turns out to be very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world making small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so the longer you make a piece of power , the more mistakes happen .
so we had to develop a new way of developing these little pieces and make the mistakes .
that was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome with the digital information .
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
we made little pieces , they made a <unk> , and they had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of <unk> chemical and put it into a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made interactive particles .
the weak particles then have taken back from the cells and came back and killed them .
recently i talked to the oil industry , and they said they had this model right .
they hide more than you here .
so we think that this is a situation where software can actually build their own hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go a lot further . we wanted to build an entire <unk> chromosome . it &apos;s got more than <unk> letters of genetic code , so we thought we could build it in a lot of the size of the virus , to understand what the individual components of a living cell are .
design is key , and if you want to launch digital information in the computer , this digital information needs to be really profound information .
when we first gave the genome in 1995 , the <unk> was at a mistake per 10,000 .
we found 30 mistakes when we had 30 mistakes . if we had used the conventional sequence , it would never have been possible .
part of the design is to make pieces of the 50 letters long , and using them with other <unk> , to build smaller <unk> .
we have unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built <unk> .
think about it : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t .
<unk> of these letters -- these letters are about 20 acids ; there &apos;s one single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
in the beginning , we only did .
some people were disappointed that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
we designed the pieces so that we could just pick them up with them , and there are enzymes that repair these repair and again .
and we started creating pieces , starting with pieces of the <unk> letters to <unk> letters , to take these <unk> together to make these pieces up , up to <unk> .
in each step we produced these pieces in the air , so we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very practical process , which you &apos;ll see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point of <unk> .
so , this looks like a <unk> .
if we get to these really big bits -- over 100,000 sources -- then they &apos;re not just going to grow into an alien environment . it &apos;s all the possibilities of modern biology , and so we kind of <unk> ourselves .
we knew about a mechanism called the <unk> <unk> that the biology uses to repair dna that can <unk> those pieces .
here &apos;s an example of that . there &apos;s a organism called <unk> <unk> , the three million wheel of radiation .
you can see in the upper field , his chromosome just falls apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything changed again .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
these organisms can be completely <unk> , they can even live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life can exist in space and move on search conditions .
in fact , nasa showed that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
so here &apos;s a <unk> of the molecule that we &apos;ve used by using these processes -- actually , we used <unk> using the right design of the pieces , we put it in there . yeast put it together .
this is not a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can actually see it with the <unk> .
these are footage over six seconds .
that &apos;s the debate that we &apos;ve just done recently .
these are over <unk> letters of <unk> code . it &apos;s the largest molecule that has ever created by humans .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we were to print it with a <unk> of 10 , without the <unk> , the genetic code would be <unk> pages .
well , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier to say , if you &apos;re in <unk> like we &apos;re doing it , and you just go out and give you another , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about .
<unk> is the chromosome in the cell , but it &apos;s only recently that what we &apos;ve shown is you can do a complete record of one cell from one cell to the other .
we <unk> the chromosome of a <unk> , and in fact , these two things are from each other like humans and mice , and we gave some tools to choose that chromosome , so we could choose it to destroy all the proteins , and it was very amazing when we gave it into a cell -- and you &apos;re going to appreciate our very <unk> <unk> .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we tried to get the process further .
that &apos;s the <unk> of evolution here .
we find all kinds of species here , or a third chromosome , or a third of <unk> , each time thousands of copies in just one second to a species .
so people who think of evolution as a gene that is changed at a time is a lot of the biology .
there are enzymes called the <unk> that are actually called dna .
the chromosome was in the cell ; the chromosomes that we &apos;ve put on .
it was <unk> and realized the other chromosome as a material material , and so we ended up with a new chromosome .
it <unk> blue because of the genes we ate .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of species lost into a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
all proteins of proteins change -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;ve been able to do .
it may sound like rare <unk> , but we can , by changing the <unk> , things quite dramatically .
now i &apos;m suggesting this is not the <unk> -- this is based on 97 billion years ago .
and i realized that we may be able to create a new form of <unk> explosion in which there might be massive new <unk> based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;ve gone from six to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
in my context , i was born in 1982 .
today , three people on this planet have existed each year ; within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , with fruit and clean water , medicine , fuel fuel .
it &apos;s going to be a challenge for nine dollars .
we need over five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion pounds of oil . that &apos;s a hundred million tons a day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s the whole co2 of this material that &apos;s going on in the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries around the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the <unk> of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components and look at the diversity of this .
what we see here is the limits of biological reality and those of our imagination .
we now have technologies because of this fast <unk> to do what we call <unk> genetics .
so we can now make a big robot to build the millions of chromosomes a day .
if you can make these 20 million different genes , or producing these processes to produce <unk> or drugs new vaccines , we can change only small team over the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can <unk> , production of chemicals , or <unk> , and so on .
this is a shot of actual <unk> that we &apos;re working on , where you actually sit out and sit new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it looks like , we know what their genetic code look like .
we &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation .
you &apos;ve recently seen ethanol , which is just a bad experiment .
we have the <unk> and third generation that are relatively soon going to have much higher <unk> , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
but , as we think , the only way that biology has a huge impact on food or the reputation of their availability is when we see co2 as a function , and so we &apos;re working on the cells to go .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first part of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is a organism that we described earlier .
it lives in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , almost <unk> <unk> .
it generates co2 in methane to use hydrogen as a source of hydrogen .
we can study if we can use <unk> co2 , which could easily be brought into <unk> , <unk> co2 in producing this process .
within a short period of time , we believe we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we have really -- <unk> goals like the <unk> of the entire industrial industry . right ? if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where else ? it &apos;s a <unk> of energy .
but in the same way , we &apos;re working on trying to use the same strategy for developing drugs .
you &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always going back to the back and have a dollar , if it comes to the right vaccine .
i think this can be changed by <unk> <unk> vaccines .
that &apos;s what the future might look like if you can change the future today , with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and perhaps <unk> .
we are light away from people . our goal is only that we have a chance to survive long enough to do it . thank you .
at the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain to you how the machine works .
so here it is . and for those of those who weren &apos;t there , the lhc was the largest scientific experiment ever ever been before -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that less than a <unk> second at the beginning of the universe -- and that &apos;s until 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just silly .
this is the machine below .
we take pictures of these <unk> in motion .
this is what i &apos;m working on . it &apos;s called disney ice -- <unk> feet in the <unk> , 22 feet in diameter .
here &apos;s a tiny picture of the graph in the construction construction that you see .
on september september last year , the machine walked for the first time .
and this picture was taken by beethoven .
it &apos;s <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
it &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> that <unk> all the way around the lhc , then <unk> part of the lhc to make a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture on september 11 , we knew that the machine works , which is a great deal .
i don &apos;t know if this was the biggest <unk> , or this , as somebody went to the google side , or this , as someone visited the google side .
it means that we have a cultural impact on the scientific process .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these <unk> .
these wires are <unk> <unk> when the machine &apos;s running on <unk> .
now , the engineers among them will look at them and say , &quot; no , no , they &apos;re little wires . &quot;
you can afford this because if you go to them very far , they become called <unk> .
so minus <unk> degrees , as the space between stars , these wires can absorb the tension .
in one of the connections between the <unk> bears in the lhc , there was a <unk> .
by doing so , the wires <unk> and <unk> <unk> suddenly suddenly resistance .
this was the result .
now , all of this , if you can imagine that this is about 20 tons and it &apos;s about 30 inches .
so we went around 50 of the magnet .
and they had to remove what we did .
we <unk> them , <unk> them .
they &apos;re all back on their way .
by the end , the lhc will be <unk> again .
we &apos;re going to collect it up , and expect first data in june or july , we can collect our journey to find out what the blocks of the universe are .
well , of course , in a way , in a way , that debate again is about the value of science and engineering on these boundaries . it &apos;s easy to make something like that .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we reach beyond our boundaries , the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my <unk> words to a english scientist , <unk> <unk> , who , as i suspect , when he <unk> the <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his name was michael <unk> , and he said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous to the development of the human mind , as to assume that our scientific beliefs is that there are no mysteries in nature that our <unk> are <unk> , and that there are no new worlds to invent . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing my job is , of course , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , love love and curiosity .
and i don &apos;t expect it to change .
however , a little curious about my life and my career has led me to rethink my relationship to this work completely .
this was an amazing event that i recently wrote a book -- a <unk> called <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> , which , unlike all of my previous books from some reasons to the world , and a large <unk> , international <unk> .
and the result is that i don &apos;t care about where i come from , i &apos;m going to be treated like i &apos;m going to be the <unk> .
seriously -- <unk> !
for example , they &apos;re worried about me and saying , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re never going to have that success ever ?
don &apos;t you fear that you ever made your entire life and you create a book that anybody in the world are interested in ?
okay , so that &apos;s really courage .
but it would be worse if i wasn &apos;t going to remind myself about 20 years ago when i first told him that i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of <unk> reaction .
people said , don &apos;t you fear , never succeed ?
didn &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re going to have a <unk> ?
do you have no fear that you &apos;d run out of your life and you never get a little bit and you &apos;re going to die on a <unk> <unk> dreams -- your mouth filled with the <unk> of failure ?
something like that , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is <unk> .
yeah , i fear all of these things .
and i &apos;ve always had that .
and i was afraid of doing a lot more things that nobody would .
like algae -- and other kinds of things .
but , when it comes to writing about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking , why ?
is that reasonable ?
is it obvious that somebody expected him to do the work he feels about ?
and what &apos;s going to do with the creative cats , that they &apos;re going to give us comfort about the <unk> -- in a way that other people don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was drunk and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist when he was asked if he was afraid he was afraid .
with your <unk> , john -- how about that ?
it just wasn &apos;t there , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of nurses don &apos;t have the reputation of <unk> people .
but we seem to have these kinds of reputation , but not just the writers , but the creative of all the <unk> , seem to have that reputation , to have that reputation .
all they have to do is look at the <unk> of really great minds alone from the 20th century that young and often died by their hand .
and even those who weren &apos;t actually <unk> , seemed to be really <unk> by their clients .
norman <unk> said shortly before his death in his last interview , <unk> , each of my books has killed me a little further .
an extraordinary statement that you can make about your life .
but we don &apos;t even know when we hear somebody say something like this , because we &apos;ve been familiar with this kind of news for so long , and somehow we &apos;ve been looking at the notion of so profound and collective , that creativity and suffering somehow <unk> and that art at the end -- always leads to <unk> .
the question i &apos;d like to ask you today is this idea of okay ?
do you feel comfortable with that ? because with only one foot , i don &apos;t feel like that at all .
i find them <unk> .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch what it was going to do next century .
i think it &apos;s better for us to live our big creative habits .
and i definitely know that for me -- in my situation , it would be very dangerous to start , this dark path of the guess , sort of <unk> -- particularly in the context where i &apos;m in my career .
that is -- i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 <unk> in me .
and it &apos;s very likely that all i &apos;m going to write from now about the world than work , which is the most successful success of my last book , which is right ?
i say it <unk> , because we &apos;re all kind of friends here -- it &apos;s very likely that my greatest success is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts that can be able to get someone in the morning , at nine o &apos;clock . and i don &apos;t want to .
i &apos;d rather continue doing that work i love .
so the question is : how ?
after a couple of time , i feel like i could continue to write a kind of <unk> psychological interface .
somehow , i have to find a way to write a safe distance between me and my very natural <unk> on what the reaction is going to be .
while i was looking for models in the last year to do this , i &apos;ve also been looking for myself in the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if they might have better or better ideas about how to help and deal with emotional risks .
this quest led me to the old valley and rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close .
but in ancient greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , ok ?
they believed creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> that comes from a distant , unknown source to people -- from <unk> , unknown reasons .
the greeks called this <unk> <unk> of creativity <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s known that he believed that he would have a <unk> that made it <unk> from further distance .
the egyptians had the same idea , called this sort of <unk> creative mind a <unk> genius .
that &apos;s great . the photographers didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of <unk> creature that believed that it lives in the walls of a <unk> -- something like <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> and the artist in the work , invisible and the result of the work .
this is brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological thing that protect you from follow your work .
and everybody knew it was that worked , right ?
the artist &apos;s artist was due to certain things like , like , too much , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t look at it all for you , everybody knew that you &apos;d have a genius genius that helped you .
if your work doesn &apos;t work -- don &apos;t make your mistake , right ?
everybody knew your genius was a little bit scary .
so people in the west really thought of creativity for a long time .
and then the renaissance came , and everything changed , and we had this big idea . and this big idea was : let &apos;s move the human individual into the center of the universe -- across all gods and abuse , and there is no room more for <unk> creatures , the <unk> of <unk> .
it &apos;s the beginning of moore &apos;s beginning , and people started to believe that creativity completely came from their own individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people call this genius or those artists -- rather than having a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think to allow a random person to think that he thinks that he &apos;s thinking , or she &apos;s like the <unk> , and the essence and the essence , and the source of all of his own creative , creative , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , a little bit too much responsibility for a <unk> , human mind .
it &apos;s like somebody to ask the sun .
the <unk> and <unk> whole <unk> , and it creates all these <unk> expectations to success .
i think this <unk> of our artists has <unk> our artists .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
perhaps too much understanding about the relationship between people and the mystery of creativity .
maybe not .
maybe for 500 years , we can &apos;t put this in a <unk> talk for 500 years .
and there are certainly people in this audience who , really , really <unk> scientific doubt about the notion of -- essentially <unk> , people who are <unk> and <unk> on their projects .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to make is : why not ?
why not think about that ?
because it makes as much sense as anything else that i &apos;ve heard of when it was about trying to explain the absolutely crazy understanding of the creative process .
a process that -- as anyone knows , who &apos;s ever tried to do something -- so in other words , everybody here -- not always the same .
in fact , he can feel pretty much <unk> .
i recently met one of those encounter when i met the extraordinary american poet <unk> , who was now over 90 , but she told me that when she was in the <unk> virginia outside the fields , she told me she would feel and hear like a poem about landscape on her .
she said it was like a <unk> train out of air .
it would be <unk> over the land .
she felt when it came , because it would take the earth under your feet .
she knew that she could only do one such moment , and that was -- in their words -- <unk> race like the devil <unk> .
she ran like the devil to the house while she was <unk> by this poem , and it was only because they had to get quickly to a piece of paper and a pen , so they had to get it , and if they were able to break it up through it , could break it on the sheet .
in other paint , they weren &apos;t fast enough . they ran and ran and ran , but they didn &apos;t get the house and the poem goes through them and they made it . she said it would go beyond land and -- as she said -- <unk> after another poet .
and then there was these moments -- the part i &apos;ll never forget -- she said that there were moments in which they almost had it .
so she &apos;s going to go to the house , looking for the paper , and the poem goes through you , and she picks a pen right now , and then she goes through her , and then she said -- she was as if she could reach on her other hand , and put it on it .
she <unk> the poem on his tail , and he pulled it back into her body and put it on the sheet of paper .
and with these opportunities , the poem came out and intact on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first .
now , when i heard that , i thought this is funny -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is going on .
it &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a <unk> . to work together , i have to stand up every day at the same time , waiting for me to go out and be really uncomfortable .
but even i have this thing in my <unk> sometimes .
and i guess many of you did .
even i had work or ideas that come from a source through me that i really can &apos;t identify .
what is this thing ?
and how do we deal with this relationship without losing our minds , but to keep ourselves in general health ?
for me , the best living example of how you can do this , the musicians tom <unk> . i asked him a few years ago for a magazine .
we talked about this topic . and you know what ? most of the time of his life , tom was the embodiment of the former modern artist , who was trying to come up with this kind of <unk> creative gesture that <unk> into him and interact with them .
but then he got older and failed . he told me he was going to one day on a <unk> in los angeles , and it all changed for him .
he was walking at high speed when he suddenly hear a little <unk> of a melody that , as it was often , is very , very hard for him to do , and he wants to have it . it &apos;s <unk> . he <unk> afterwards , but he can &apos;t make it .
he has no piece of paper , he has no pen , he has no pen .
so he starts to put these old <unk> into him , like <unk> , i &apos;m going to lose this thing and i will be <unk> by this song .
i &apos;m not good enough ; i don &apos;t .
but instead of going to panic , he stopped just stopped .
he opened all the <unk> and did something completely new .
he just looked in the sky and said , sorry sorry , can &apos;t you see that i &apos;m driving car ?
<unk> am i looking like i could just write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a <unk> moment if i can take care of you .
if not , <unk> is somebody else .
go ahead and <unk> <unk> .
his whole team has changed .
not the work itself . it &apos;s been as dark as dark and ever .
but the process and the heavy <unk> that went through it was much more than he took the genius out of it , where he didn &apos;t have anything to do any kind of thing and put it on where it was , and he realized that it wasn &apos;t a <unk> thing to have it .
there was a <unk> , <unk> collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and <unk> thing , which wasn &apos;t quite tom .
when i heard this story , it changed a little bit the way i was working and it saved me once .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> , and i fell into one of these <unk> of the <unk> that we all fall when we work on something and it doesn &apos;t work . you think it &apos;s a disaster . that &apos;s the worst book ever written .
not just bad , but worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just <unk> the project .
but then i remembered how tom was talking in the wild sky , and i tried .
so i came up with my view and i was talking to my blog in the empty corner of the room .
i spoke loud : <unk> listen , you do , you and i both know if this book &apos;s not brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see i have everything that i have , i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you &apos;ve got to <unk> here and share the percentage of the people .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that ... you know what , then the devil with it .
i &apos;m still going to write , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to please give you that i was here today for my part of the jobs .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like follows . centuries ago , in the united states , <unk> people have been <unk> with sacred <unk> and music , the hours of <unk> -- all the way to the back .
these were always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but back and again , very rare , what happened was one of the people who actually got <unk> .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen that performance in your life already .
it was like the time <unk> and the dancers went through a kind of <unk> . he did nothing differently than he ever did -- 1,000 nights before . but everything was combined together .
and all of a sudden , he no longer suddenly human .
it was surrounded by the inside and from the bottom , and it &apos;s all <unk> fire .
when this happened then , people knew what that was . they called it in his name .
they put the hands together and started singing : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god .
this is god , you know ?
interesting historic : when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , they brought this practice . the <unk> changed over centuries of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who you still hear at <unk> and <unk> .
if a tumor in spain has done something magical , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , there it is : a <unk> look at god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
but the most interesting part follows the next morning , when the dancers <unk> himself and realize that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock in a tuesday -- and he &apos;s no longer going to be a <unk> of god .
he &apos;s only a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and maybe he &apos;s never going to go back to that level .
and maybe god will never call god names when he turns out , but what would he do to the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most <unk> of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of <unk> if they didn &apos;t believe in the beginning , the most extraordinary aspects of their existence .
if you just think that you &apos;re a <unk> -- from a <unk> source for a <unk> of your life that someone else will die when you &apos;re done .
when we start thinking about it , all that changes .
so i started thinking , and so , certainly in the past months , i think , as i was working on the book , which is soon going to appear -- as the dangerous , <unk> , strong <unk> of my <unk> success .
what i &apos;ve got to say , even if i &apos;m crazy about it , is this : don &apos;t fear .
be <unk> .
just do your job .
be forever for your contribution , whatever he may be .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the stupid feels genius that you &apos;re asked to be asked to give you a sense of wonder through your effort , then <unk> <unk> !
and if not , however , your dance does .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you despite that .
i believe this and i feel we should teach .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you despite all the time , just for you to have the mere human love and the <unk> to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i showed these two slides to demonstrate that the arctic <unk> , which , for nearly three million years , was the size of the lower indian states , by 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t mean strong enough of this particular problem , because it &apos;s not the thick of the ice .
in a sense , the rise of <unk> is the <unk> heart of our global <unk> .
it grows in winter and summer in summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is what &apos;s happened in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is covered with red .
as you can see , it grows to the <unk> , which is the gdp ice in winter ; and it <unk> in summer .
the so-called <unk> , five years old or older , almost like blood , which comes out of the body here .
in 25 years , this is going to be gone from here .
this is a problem because the warming is the frozen cause of the arctic ocean , where there are huge amounts of carbon carbon in which there &apos;s huge amounts of carbon carbon in there , which is when it &apos;s <unk> , of microbes to methane .
compared to the entire amount of genetic pollution in the atmosphere , it could double if we cross that critical point .
already today , in some flat lakes in alaska methane from the water .
professor <unk> university in alaska is with another <unk> sea last winter .
wow !
you &apos;re fine . the question is how is it going to tell us .
and one reason is that enormous <unk> greenland greenland from north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume are much bigger than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in northern greenland .
if you want to know what the sea level is going up to the sea here .
these rivers take <unk> .
at the other end of the planet , antarctica , the largest <unk> on the planet .
last month , researchers announced that the entire continent has now been a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> that <unk> over a few <unk> is particularly strong .
this is about 20 feet , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , you see the new lakes that happened a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half their <unk> from this <unk> .
in the 1970s , this glaciers is the <unk> for this city .
<unk> have <unk> .
but when it turns out , most of the water is <unk> .
in california , a 40 percent reduction was seen in the <unk> of sierra .
this is the <unk> .
and the predictions , as you read them , are serious .
those <unk> around the world leads to a dramatic increase in fire .
and the disasters everywhere in the world have really <unk> , and before they &apos;ve never seen before .
four times as many in the last 30 years , like in the <unk> .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it is .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve produced 70 million tons of co2 , every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day in the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific right now , from the american continent and the <unk> of indian <unk> , where there &apos;s a <unk> decline in the oceans .
the biggest one factor for global warming , next degrees , which is 20 percent , is to burn fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the dominant biggest problem .
the united states is one of the two largest <unk> , combined with china .
and the suggestion was to build many more <unk> .
but we start to see change .
here are the ones that have been collected in the last few years with some green alternatives .
there is a political argument in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have spent a <unk> dollar record to make clean coal , which is a contradiction .
this picture reminded me of something .
around christmas , at home in tennessee , a billion tons of <unk> .
you saw it in the news .
this is in our entire country of <unk> <unk> america .
this happened to christmas .
one of the <unk> was around christmas christmas .
<unk> is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s in skin and abundance in america , and it helps to grow our economy .
<unk> , the <unk> will clean every day .
it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> , and workers stay in and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the head of <unk> <unk> .
let me clear you one very clearly . al gore , ben <unk> , harry <unk> , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for two workers started to live into life .
this is one part of her .
in effect , we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
that &apos;s why we set it up to the top <unk> , a <unk> <unk> to get a <unk> on the path to tell the truth about coal .
the fact is coal is not delicious .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and still good well .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
leave it to us .
<unk> coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
so let &apos;s make a tour of these modern , <unk> <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of the perfect <unk> .
and yet , the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming that you see here , which changes everything .
look at this , this is today &apos;s economy , clean <unk> .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red beetle , which connects all of these together , is our dependence on <unk> <unk> like <unk> coal and <unk> oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to get us out of this <unk> situation .
<unk> america with 100 percent clean electricity within the next 10 years .
a plan to get america back to work is to make ourselves safer and help global warming .
finally , a solution is big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america . find more .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest ways to <unk> our dependence on ancient , <unk> <unk> , to reduce our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investment to create good jobs .
<unk> america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
if you want far , go together . &quot;
we need to get far , fast .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to start by asking you at the time of your childhood when she played <unk> .
while they figured out how to <unk> the hands and the <unk> , the <unk> , and moving them , they actually learned to think and to solve problems by understanding the way that we do .
the media thinking is deeply connected to how we understand most of our environment .
as a musician , inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- along with my <unk> <unk> and my colleague <unk> , i began to wonder : what if we were using computers , the instead of a <unk> , who &apos;s moving like a digital <unk> on a flat , what if we could move with both hands and make data physically and make them happen like we want it ?
and that question was so unexpected that we developed the answer to the answer and <unk> .
in short , a <unk> is a molecular computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can move with your hand , you can see each other , you can pick up your movements , and you have a screen and you &apos;re a <unk> .
much more importantly , if you &apos;re physically , why you can only move them like <unk> through your hands and access .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> to personalized digital data .
and when these tools are available and they &apos;re developing consciousness for their movements , each other and the <unk> of our <unk> with them , then we can start with exploration new and more innovative .
i start with some simple examples .
this <unk> is for the <unk> , and when i put it in a direction , the video will come forward , and as i move it into the other direction , it goes backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other true .
so when i put them next to each other , that &apos;s their interest .
if you &apos;re <unk> around you , you &apos;ll notice that , and you can get a little nervous .
and they also feel their movements and desire .
so , a interesting consequence of interactions that we started to recognize was that we could apply everyday gestures on data , like colors , how to do it with transportation .
in this case , we have three <unk> as <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to put color in the middle in the middle , where they &apos;re being <unk> .
if we <unk> it , we can <unk> a little bit .
there are also some nice opportunities in education like languages , mathematics , or <unk> , where we give people the possibility of fast people and see the results immediately .
here i am -- this is a keyboard i had with a simple <unk> .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
basically you get every round of <unk> on every <unk> letter , and as you try to form words , they become a dictionary .
then after about 30 seconds , again , again and you have a new <unk> and new possibilities .
thank you .
these are some kids who came to the media lab at the media lab , and i was able to move it and try a video of it .
they really loved it .
a interesting thing about this kind of applications is you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; abstract words , &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s a couple of people who test it .
this is our <unk> <unk> down there right now .
and it turned out that he wanted to stack the <unk> .
so for him , they were just <unk> .
this is a interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a model for <unk> .
this is <unk> .
he can put new characters into the scene by looking at the <unk> at the table that this character shows .
here it leaves the sun .
the sun goes down .
now , he &apos;s now going to move into the scene .
the orange bubble .
good work ! yes !
by <unk> the <unk> , and she &apos;s able to make the characters interact ...
... his own story invent .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open end , and he can decide how they evolved .
flying cat .
the last example i have for today , for which i have time to show you , is a <unk> model for <unk> that we &apos;ve developed recently and in the <unk> as a sound , like <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
each has four different variations ; you can choose which one wants to use .
and you can put these notes into the sequence that you can build in any patterns again .
and you put them together by just putting a <unk> on a <unk> .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filter .
you connect it with a particular note , and then you put it on the phone .
and then the same effects , like the speed and the <unk> that you take on the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
and what we &apos;re starting to do is we start with the <unk> in two <unk> and those in a series of sequence , and they expand and slightly more of the voice .
now i &apos;m going to add a plane .
now i &apos;m going to do something about this .
and now i &apos;m going to turn to the filter so that i can control the effect live .
i can speed all the sequence by putting the speed in one way or another .
and now i &apos;m going to go through the filter again , for something more expression .
i can transform the sequence as it &apos;s going on .
and by doing so , i don &apos;t have to plan it in the <unk> , but you can paint it ; you &apos;re developing it up to you .
and finally , i can <unk> all the sequence by looking to the left .
thank you .
so as you can see , my desire is to develop new tools that are better to fit the way our brains work and bodies .
and today i had time to give you some of these new <unk> and some of the possibilities that we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the idea that i want to leave you with , is that we &apos;re at the threshold of this new generation of <unk> to interaction media , to bring information to our world , which is our needs .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking at the conversations with you all .
yes , good day .
i &apos;m very happy to be there .
yeah , so what should be <unk> ?
i &apos;ve just got to go back a little bit , and this is a <unk> moment with modern biology .
i study biology , and i &apos;ve been looking at this for a couple of years now , and that &apos;s what i started doing , because i just wanted to know , and it also wanted to do it even myself , which i learned in studying research .
so , that was my emotional motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to sort closer to the matter , like this .
i think that the genetics are generally now , so generally , what you need to do is synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important is already extremely important , and much more important , much more important in the future .
there &apos;s all kinds of things like this whole <unk> plants on the <unk> .
now there &apos;s craig venter in the <unk> that tries to make <unk> , so gas from algae .
and then there are things that are completely active in everyday life , which is most aware of most of the people , for example , that allow us to clean up with low degrees degrees , including <unk> <unk> .
and you can continue the list .
and so from the interest in this technology , i &apos;m going to go on further .
so what &apos;s now going on ?
most people know that from the <unk> .
and then , in media , the media is always like this , yes , the hackers break somewhere somewhere and electronic data and so on .
it &apos;s kind of like the <unk> , because it &apos;s not what it really started like , and what really started behind it .
and that &apos;s actually the <unk> , in the &apos; 50s , <unk> with <unk> , and that &apos;s also the internet .
and it &apos;s about working with a simple , creative way of solving a problem .
and problem , it &apos;s not just a technical problem ; it can be a <unk> problem , it can just be a <unk> , which is like things <unk> , which is a <unk> question , a question , and how can you do it differently or how you can do it better .
and it &apos;s been used to do with software , but there &apos;s also a whole <unk> , there &apos;s also a whole kind of <unk> that make all kinds of <unk> stuff .
and now , also , in the direction of biology , and what i want to do here is this metaphor which comes out from synthetic biology , is that biology is actually a <unk> , because , the <unk> code is a positive code , which is yes , it &apos;s not the same as computers , because it &apos;s dynamic , which is real matter , and it &apos;s not just <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can program , you know , also you can program it , so you can also <unk> it , like that , and that &apos;s what i find is incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper .
this actually took eight eight really shape , these networks .
there &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe and with a cooperation in india in india , but now members or active people all over the world .
now , that &apos;s got a more artistic point , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and philosophers and working with scientists with scientists to look at these technologies and ask the creative thing , there &apos;s <unk> and yes , all kinds of things .
but it &apos;s actually always about trying to have such a <unk> access to have a <unk> effect on it .
and then there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
this is from the <unk> of a network , which is actually more of the kind of water where you stop and talk online .
they &apos;re a little bit harder , and also a little bit of <unk> around , because they &apos;re also going to ask .
and based on these networks that &apos;ve been doing the whole thing , this has actually developed a scene like this , which i &apos;d like to wait for a moment .
this is a picture in the left on the left , which is a <unk> , so basically a school , basically , a private school , where anyone can get .
kids , old , all kinds of people go there to just move around with it , they have a lab and look at what you can do when these <unk> are .
here on the left is a group in indonesia called <unk> , which is , but there &apos;s pretty long .
it &apos;s longer than these other networks .
they also have an artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , also <unk> , and combine that in a fairly <unk> way .
a group of reasons that i met for a while a while ago , who really wanted to support the public in public what they learn in college , and they &apos;ve been trying to explain and explain what is wrong .
and i got up on the top of a lecture in copenhagen in copenhagen in the medical museum with an exhibition .
and this is , yes , this is the most kind of young people , but the only thing that what really does all of that is is this fascination in technology .
and what you can do with it , and you can also focus on society with it and ask them , okay , okay , what do you want to do , you &apos;ve got interest in it for you to deal with it ?
so , in order to make biology now , you kind of need material .
you need biological materials , of course , and you need tools , and that &apos;s then a lab .
so , for example , what you normally understand under a lab , which is sort of <unk> machines , extremely expensive , extremely <unk> , only for <unk> , trained academics , and so on .
and our approach was just to say , well , you don &apos;t have to do that .
this is actually not necessary , because each one of them has actually higher higher technology than most people , it really is .
and the gentleman with this premise , for instance , has tried brian <unk> in england , which is a <unk> <unk> , then took a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , and , yeah , so <unk> , and then it <unk> bacteria .
so anyone who has been a soup for a long time has left it for a long time .
i then tried it in my lab , a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit , and then i bought that kind of <unk> analysis on ebay , and i tried to do a little bit of <unk> analysis , trying to get a <unk> , so you know , <unk> <unk> , again .
now this shouldn &apos;t actually be a joke .
so , down here in the picture , you see the lab , in <unk> , so this is a <unk> garage , with all kinds of <unk> , which is the university in paris , a group in paris who has come up with something and pretty successful , and also quite interesting things , because i want to make a very interesting thing about it .
and this is <unk> , which also mentioned <unk> , this one , sort of <unk> , basically for molecular biology .
and yes , so , you can see , it &apos;s relatively <unk> , so that &apos;s where people who make it alone , all the way up to large organizations are larger organizations that are going to do that already in <unk> form .
but always always the idea that it should just stop and open .
the first project that we did as an international group , as we were aware of ourselves , we think there is now real scene here , and we are online , and we know so the people who are always <unk> and so on .
and then from the <unk> <unk> website , the founder of the founder , and said , well , we &apos;ve got to meet now , really meet , also make real meeting , and then two things organized , one in london , <unk> 10 , and shortly in the <unk> , san francisco .
and then , since then it was about , yes , who are we , what do we want to share ?
and what are our values and what is our genius , our foundation ?
and then there is a <unk> .
so that was quite intuitive , so everybody just has his wishes , his sense of what &apos;s moving him , then .
there came , i think , a very good code .
and we didn &apos;t get there , but i think that &apos;s a good thing , i think , pretty well , people have quite convinced of this .
and we even tried to put it into the academic world , but it &apos;s kind of not like that .
so i think we &apos;re actually going to take a step further than the academic world .
yeah , what kind of projects are we doing now ?
so , a project that i did with the <unk> in switzerland , was that we wanted to create a so-called optical event or synthetic <unk> .
that &apos;s when you put a <unk> in a room , in a room , and then you can put small particles in the air , or in the liquid , and then move around in that focus , so that &apos;s going to be there , like this , like a <unk> , basically .
so this really works , this is going to be done in the academic lab , and we thought we thought , well , we &apos;ll get that maybe , then we have a cross , the <unk> , the lens , the lens , you have a microscope , you have a microscope that goes around .
you see that down there .
and then we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then we try and try to focus on that camera .
and it didn &apos;t work , unfortunately , but we &apos;ve learned a lot about it .
this is another project that came out of the french group in paris , and it &apos;s pretty cool .
he &apos;s got such a well , such a <unk> , or something like this , so he &apos;s busy his <unk> , his <unk> is sam <unk> .
he then turned into that helmet there , and in cooperation with the museum , the museum is .
so there &apos;s going to go into the room and sit on this chair , looking at this chair .
then they became measured , and depending on what they thought or how they thought they thought was different lights in space .
it was a pretty <unk> project .
another thing from the united states , which also has to do with this <unk> , is the <unk> , which is the <unk> , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copy your genes , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , so that you can make them visible .
so , if i do this , i &apos;m going to do this at the library , go out there , collect any <unk> , and then they do this method , and then you can say , well , that hair belongs to that person .
and the machines that are doing this , they &apos;re pretty expensive , they &apos;re pretty expensive , and they &apos;re going to buy stuff that are going to go out like this .
and it &apos;s not in the <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be very much .
so that &apos;s just one application that you can do with this .
and they &apos;ve been saying that there &apos;s two <unk> <unk> , and they said , well , well , we &apos;re going to do simpler and cheaper , and then you &apos;ve just made up of open source , so you &apos;re free to the hardware , you know , this device , and you &apos;ve got that kind of device , and you &apos;ve actually brought this device in the world , and now you &apos;re the <unk> of these devices around the world .
i think kind of like <unk> dollars or something like that .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s not cheap at any point where it &apos;s going to be clear .
so , i think it &apos;s a very <unk> <unk> .
one project i started to start was building a <unk> .
<unk> , yeah , like this <unk> , which is about something like this , two inches or something .
you put <unk> on the <unk> , and then you put it into these <unk> , and then i put it on a <unk> , and then i put it on the air .
so the device that you see there , that didn &apos;t work .
but that &apos;s my prototype that &apos;s my prototype , but it &apos;s kind of <unk> like this , so on a window that was kind of thing on it , electronics and pressure , and it was the pressure too high , the thing is broken .
and then i took a <unk> and put it on it .
a <unk> , if you make the full power with water , it has enough pressure , so i think , close to <unk> .
and with that , you can speed up particles enough , and then you can go in the <unk> .
and the commercial device costs about <unk> dollars or something , <unk> like that .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically <unk> .
so that &apos;s a moment at the moment that &apos;s the <unk> of the scene , this availability of technology , and also the information , and the <unk> , that more people can get involved .
because , as in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of it , and it &apos;s also not a chance to make it well .
because , if you just read about it , <unk> , that &apos;s not the same thing as if you did it yourself or saw it .
and i think technology is increasingly important in our modern societies .
and if you want to meet <unk> citizens in society , if you want to meet , you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it and understand it and understand it .
and then , under the <unk> open <unk> and <unk> science .
so that you &apos;re going to be used as citizens into the situation , with these scientific technologies .
and this is the <unk> of <unk> .
these are the people who at least have been <unk> at least on the website , <unk> website .
it &apos;s a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;re also central in ireland .
i think that &apos;s where there are fewer people out there than actually exist .
so i know some people who don &apos;t know .
and these are just the nurses that are the individual people .
in part , with these <unk> , these places are out there .
and that &apos;s in the beginning .
as i said , it first started .
and <unk> , so the <unk> , because the <unk> in berlin was the first one , <unk> .
and this is now a massive network of very good , yes , <unk> that are represented all over the world .
and we hope that , of course , we &apos;re also going to <unk> ourselves , and then we &apos;re also <unk> together so you can also be involved with people .
and i would invite everyone once to go and try and try and try and try and try .
now it &apos;s not that easy , but it &apos;s also not impossible , if you have enough curiosity and enough energy , you get too far .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yeah , hello .
how do we actually work ?
this is a question that really moved me as a designer , but also in the <unk> of <unk> and all sorts of things in the field of <unk> .
it &apos;s about how do you get people into interactive media , so you can use these interactive media to create these interactive media , and they create a very specific experience .
in fact , i think the interactive media within us are cognitive models , cognitive models , which means that , in our biological memory , are very , very long ago , and that we can actually <unk> the right through interactive media .
and this is very amazing , because you actually believe that these <unk> , you know , that &apos;s actually going to take you into the future , but in fact , the future is that the future is exactly in our <unk> roots .
now , what are <unk> models ?
i &apos;ve got four <unk> and i &apos;d like to explain a short story .
to <unk> cognitive models , which is the models that we &apos;ve been interested in in the <unk> times .
so to these <unk> models , we heard that we have an area of natural relationship to attitudes .
now this may sound unusual .
but i &apos;m going to go back to that right again , and i &apos;m going to prove to you by trying to prove that you have a natural relationship to ethics .
the second thing is that since this <unk> models , we &apos;ve been able to talk very , very <unk> , although we use a <unk> language today .
and the third area that explains itself .
we all know that the interactive media is the definition of definition , which includes the <unk> of the <unk> , and what we &apos;re natural about , of course , is that we are as normal today today .
the fourth point is that history is a place for us .
now , what about mit , which is actually the most important thing in the world .
i &apos;d like to prove that to you .
how many doors did the house in which they live ?
i &apos;m not going to show you that immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen right now .
you go through this house , you &apos;d live in <unk> , and look at how many doors there are .
and that &apos;s what they do .
it <unk> reality , all without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and so , for example , we give ourselves a lot of the virtual reality in our <unk> , and we can actually do it all the time .
and that wealth to <unk> the virtual reality that people needed in the <unk> times because they had nothing .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have <unk> .
they had no media .
the only thing they had was their head .
and in that head , memory was going off .
in this head , knowledge and using this virtual images , the imagination , they were also known as well .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so strong in us that we can deal with mice as well .
the interesting thing about this is when i can make a little trip .
yeah , it goes .
what &apos;s interesting about this is that at that time , human and medium had been <unk> and medium .
now , if you think about it a little bit .
what are media ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there is a change .
but that &apos;s what i &apos;ll get to talk about again .
the most powerful tool of <unk> have been a long story .
<unk> , <unk> , so-called <unk> , were allowed to keep knowledge in stories .
and today we are still very , very strong to stories .
the author of the book , jonathan <unk> , jonathan <unk> , we &apos;re still <unk> hours with the <unk> of stories .
that means for a child who has spent most of his life to reach over most of his life .
now we think , our love of stories depends on us as a child on the lap of our parents .
no , no , far away .
this goes back to the cultures of <unk> times .
but to me , in the realm of interactive media , as a particularly impressive , is that we have a <unk> in our biological memory , the ability to think about it .
i gave you an example from the oxford tribe of <unk> .
and the lives lived in the <unk> of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very <unk> area , and you had to get out of island , from island to island to get food .
and they &apos;ve done this with so-called <unk> .
you may know that if you care about that , you might know about the <unk> .
they have similar principles .
they have no <unk> , but they &apos;ve used the so-called <unk> or <unk> .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the <unk> and the <unk> are made by regions on songs .
whereas the language of <unk> <unk> was <unk> .
that means you &apos;re talking about sound and about rhythm .
and these sounds , and this rhythm have the <unk> , which is a region of a region , and of course that allows you to put that songs together and then put it in a different way , go back to the left , and also to move back to the back .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to get from the top to b ?
anyway , to navigate .
what &apos;s happening here ?
that &apos;s what happened so <unk> .
we &apos;ve been moving earlier in this way .
what happened , and it happened , and it happened , and it happened to be the book .
and that &apos;s what happens is that we have responsibility for our memories and our own production of the individual memories of our individual media .
the book and the picture .
so unfortunately , we unfortunately have a piece of <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> has become a great force for us , and it has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a famous <unk> at <unk> , has been so far back to say that this innovation , he says the book and the picture , so on , not the television , the internet and so on , and so on , what we call a social organization today , that this landscape of our memories have changed and our ability to have <unk> .
let &apos;s make a little <unk> .
from the <unk> to the building .
what has our thinking and our thinking about our thinking ?
then the <unk> model of <unk> cultures .
and they &apos;re going to have been <unk> over the course of centuries over the centuries .
that means that instead of remember , we &apos;ve been able to remember , far more common , in massive different patterns of memories that we can see our personal memories .
we &apos;re not producing ourselves .
we have a abstract language .
we don &apos;t ask the thing anymore in pictures of the things we don &apos;t see in images , but we put them on our language .
we used to think things happen .
and we accepted the norm as law , and there are only exceptions , like the <unk> .
what &apos;s happened to us is <unk> .
still , we &apos;re still very , very strong with <unk> .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , we had the <unk> , and we now put it so called <unk> .
it sounds very <unk> , and it sounds very <unk> , i know .
but these concepts of the <unk> that bring us that opportunity back to explore our capabilities .
it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to just quickly explain this a little bit .
there are technical concepts like this , for example , the <unk> reality .
so , for example , if you look at google , for example , this is a concept of what makes us combine the virtual world with the real world , that means our <unk> to <unk> , which is virtual as something normal to feel natural .
another example is the so-called virtual reality .
so , of course , that &apos;s sound , of course , in the context of my talk , because we &apos;re moving into physically , virtual worlds , looking at the model of <unk> .
and other example are the <unk> , smart systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a human .
all this requires the ability to accept our basic ability as a real habitat .
i &apos;ve come in , and i hope the video works , a very , very beautiful project , which is the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and they &apos;re also here today .
maybe you can get up for a minute so you can actually talk to the two of the two .
and i have this project as an example of how , again , this <unk> , cognitive models .
the whole one is a game i have to say .
of course , the <unk> of course , and it &apos;s a computer .
and when i say , you &apos;re very likely to tell you that any people in front of you are <unk> , or you play with some <unk> in your hand .
anyway , you do that .
this is a game for outside .
and that &apos;s when i think , in fact , that i choose the outside world , so i &apos;m going to <unk> the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data that we produce with the real world .
i &apos;m sorry that i have to take so much .
you can explain it much better because there &apos;s more more behind it .
it &apos;s about taking a city by looking at which places positive or negative .
and so , from the city , i get a whole different picture , a very different impression , which is to look at negative and positive parts of a city and so in this way , a virtual map of a very real city .
and we can look at that now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation of what you &apos;re about to see .
of course , this virtual world in the walls of our cities is clear .
and in a way , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
so , i like to think of that in my talk , and in the sense that the properties and the skills that we have made out of the <unk> and the skills that we have a little bit of <unk> on the board , that with the help of this so-called <unk> <unk> , and that in this way , we don &apos;t actually come back to the future , we &apos;re actually coming back to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
i &apos;ve been asked for a moment to have been asked whether this is a <unk> and mine instead of talking .
it won &apos;t do it .
i &apos;m also going to get into what &apos;s in there .
but anyway , i just do it a little bit curious .
yes , kids are naturally curious or should be curious , designers too .
i &apos;m from the house , so , of course , to the subject of curiosity and how changes the curiosity again are our thinking , and why we may lose curiosity , and so on and so forth .
this is a whole range of things that people are dealing with the actual deal of life .
when professors are curious , they &apos;re often in such &apos; n <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve had last year .
a <unk> on the subject of social design .
now you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why are all the ways that you start with so natural , <unk> <unk> of communication , interaction and so on .
and because i just think of one of these little devices , because things are supposed to be always more and natural and natural , and you have to look at what &apos;s actually natural for us , of course , which is <unk> or intuitive .
and before the background , i &apos;ve been interested in the field of social design , which is the next generation of human computers , so the next generation in the relationship of the human computer , is thinking about how our tools or how the computer has changed the computer from the computer to the digital program .
so i was busy thinking about when , of course , of course .
maybe again , a look at that .
why is this happening at all ?
so if we look at the development of our society , we &apos;re moving right now from the third to the fourth <unk> or <unk> .
so from modern to <unk> .
every society is shaped by a <unk> .
at the beginning , through language .
so , you &apos;ve found that you &apos;ve talked to a common language , you could communicate with each other into the same cave , or in other areas , cities have educated or villages , and has kind of designed <unk> .
but that was the language , something very natural , something very natural .
so you had to learn from nature , so there &apos;s no way to talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it , of course .
that was then <unk> by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
this was a <unk> , of course , because , of course , the living language began to <unk> in the form of writing , which means , what &apos;s alive and alive , i &apos;m going to get it in stone , and i put it in stone .
depending on how i <unk> , and when i <unk> , of course , it &apos;s a very different story than when there &apos;s a lifetime of life .
but then <unk> came out to be a <unk> .
then the next generation we &apos;re actually living in today .
this is just through the pressure and <unk> <unk> writing and others .
at that time , it was kind of a <unk> where there was a <unk> , <unk> , and other people , if you were to start reading the people , the people want to start reading , and that &apos;s , of course , totally <unk> .
and now we &apos;re going to come to the next generation , and the exciting thing is , this is just a few hundred years , and we &apos;re really in this <unk> phase right now that we &apos;re involved in that .
and of course , this makes us totally , because we &apos;re looking at the new media , <unk> social media , facebook and so on .
with the absolute transparency , what the new thinking is , what &apos;s looking at the old thinking , don &apos;t say that in <unk> <unk> , and no one is a phenomena or other phenomena , which is what i just want to do , and i want to <unk> it .
and these two worlds are just coming together , new and old thinking .
and the exciting thing about this is , if you put that together , this new society , these <unk> , are very many mechanisms , principles and <unk> , from the <unk> .
now , not on the local level , but on global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
this is a global ecology .
not when i think of local complex , and the neighbor thinks less complex , then it doesn &apos;t work anymore .
that is , from local village , in fact , has become a global village with the same principles , of course , but the total transparency , but the total transparency .
as you were in the village , who had something to whom and when , this is what happens today about this extension of our self through this mobile <unk> at global level .
be that we know globally and faster and faster and better .
just as it used to be on the village before .
in front of the background , i &apos;ve been looking around with this , which means that for us , of course , what is even natural for us , what have we also been doing , what is the difference to us ?
because people often come , they can &apos;t do it <unk> , so everybody can deal with it .
so you have to deal with what it means , and it &apos;s not just changing it , it should be better .
and when , of course , something weird and how , of course , i can influence as a feature of influence , and just looking at things like this , that it &apos;s a <unk> , so it &apos;s very intuitive , because then they &apos;re fun and they &apos;re easy to use .
and then you start thinking , also during the ages , with the subject of perception and <unk> .
and that , of course , is what you start and look at and say , okay , now i just look into the inside itself .
and what &apos;s inside here ?
so how do we work when we <unk> ?
and then , of course , what means , of course , and how do we work with perception of perception , and how does cognitive design work ?
because steve jobs used to say , you know , you know , you know , you know , <unk> <unk> to your <unk> .
so you really have to look at the detail , if i want to do something <unk> or weird , which means in the core .
and that &apos;s where you see a &quot; seven senses &quot; -- most of us think we &apos;ve only got five , we &apos;re now seven , at least seven , because there is certainly seven future in the future , there certainly makes sense , and as an extension again , our self .
and to look at how process we use information ?
just to say , what is information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
many use the word , but i don &apos;t know what makes it detail .
but i have to understand , in the core , understanding when becomes information , when comes from data , and from information again , that i know how to do things also , or , of course , <unk> things .
and of course , how does design influence the perception .
so what we &apos;re seeing here is , when i look at things , i can make them warm like on the right , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s salt and g , or i can make them kind of intuitive by doing things .
so very much natural , which is in an airplane , but i see directly where it &apos;s salt and air .
and when i tell someone , give me salt or <unk> , he will be thinking about where is inside .
and then on the left , i hope there &apos;s no sugar in there , hopefully there &apos;s no sugar inside the salt .
but also our perception of ourselves , how do they do it .
for example , the perception in context .
the right circle looks bigger than the small , even though that &apos;s not the case , but they are exactly the same size , and yet our perception , depending on what context we do .
anybody know what that is ?
<unk> on .
<unk> <unk> should still work .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s like to me .
so it &apos;s &apos; n circle .
a second circle starts to <unk> certain sounds , or <unk> .
and if i don &apos;t wait a <unk> , then suddenly we don &apos;t have another one , which is circle , circle , circle , but yet we see a unit , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , a circle , another one .
something called <unk> or <unk> , which also affects us again in perception .
what &apos;s important to the people who used to do this in the first line , the great <unk> .
<unk> , the <unk> of the wave and so on .
often in the third , again .
but that &apos;s an important important part , if you just want to design things as well as possible .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting .
sounds very excited about it , but it &apos;s really exciting when you &apos;re busy it .
so we have the eyes , and now you &apos;re thinking , we &apos;re looking back at the front of the front .
that &apos;s wrong .
you &apos;re looking back in front of the front .
because , you know , it <unk> a assumption that you see something that you can see , <unk> circle .
that means we only see our vision before we see it back back in our <unk> to say , okay .
i have so much cognitive <unk> , you have what <unk> , what you want to see .
and then that &apos;s where it comes back .
and then , again , it goes forward , because the back of the front doesn &apos;t say , and she says , now , i really want to ask you for sure if that &apos;s what you see , that &apos;s what you want to see .
and then it goes back to the back , and it &apos;s really just seen it .
so a whole , very <unk> process , like certain things , and what kind of <unk> things happen .
i don &apos;t know who you know this picture .
that &apos;s exactly what i described .
now everybody &apos;s trying to see something from this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes what recognizes .
does anybody see something special ?
a <unk> , right .
once i saw this , it &apos;s a <unk> in there , then you know that .
you &apos;ll never forget about it , because i &apos;ll show you where it is .
now you see the <unk> .
and further , now look at him .
that means i &apos;ve actually shown you now , you know , that you &apos;re not aware of any pattern , but i &apos;ve <unk> it within time to see that dog in this picture .
and this projection of view , <unk> , vision .
now i know it , and now i &apos;m going to leave you right now i see the <unk> .
i see the <unk> .
so , very exciting processes , which then you see in this , yes , gray , it &apos;s not , but you can see here in this <unk> mass .
anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
this is our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
if i know , take three seconds , until i sort of get out of the present in the present , i can also bring it very well as i do with three seconds .
it has to process it first .
and then it goes into the past , and so i can put very elegant <unk> on the computer when i know this phenomenon .
what takes a difference ?
yeah , diamonds .
it &apos;s also a remarkable phenomenon .
that &apos;s the period where you love in love .
that means if you know , look at this , look at who you like for a long time , because i don &apos;t have any <unk> for what can happen to you .
and <unk> <unk> , also an extraordinary phenomenon .
that &apos;s the period of most perceptions we have .
that means that this first impression happens in a very fast speed of how we perceive things .
and as we see things , we look at what we look at , and how we adapt ourselves to the environment so we can think about it .
of course , the arts not only have to deal with the topic and <unk> , but of course , as opposed to the subject of <unk> .
so , like a human being , with certain things .
so there &apos;s <unk> functions , so <unk> aspects or <unk> aspects .
there &apos;s <unk> where i know exactly where to reach .
but there &apos;s also some fundamental functions , why do you have somebody for such a little <unk> , where no matter what <unk> does , such a <unk> amount of money , even though it &apos;s not that practical ?
we &apos;re more on the <unk> , on the <unk> that we are , of course , too .
back to my real topic of visual behavior and the subject , which , of course , is <unk> .
<unk> means always the way i can achieve a certain goal , or how can a users in a particular <unk> can be effective , efficient and <unk> .
that &apos;s what the norm says .
how can i make something possible ?
can i use that directly or i need &apos; n or i need to use it .
and less <unk> or <unk> is it .
i only do it differently and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better .
you have to understand that .
and then , if you look at the software that we &apos;ve just seen , it &apos;s going to understand why <unk> percent of our current software or <unk> is <unk> , the <unk> in many areas , or <unk> , even though it &apos;s far more relevant than classic software .
it &apos;s not only since apple &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , if i want to make technology possible to people .
why ?
because in the rule , we are in the rule of this new kind of <unk> , which is the natural <unk> , for example , five times faster than our goal .
you have to imagine that if you do something about classical <unk> , five hours of need and using this new kind of natural software .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re probably going to go home four hours or you can go home , but your stroke , or you &apos;re going to see how to do it with four hours .
but i want to say that it &apos;s natural for us , of course , to make certain things .
so if we go back to the area of software , here &apos;s how the first <unk> are very abstract , where you needed months to deal with these systems .
then the next one , which has already been working with , now , with the <unk> model , or mental model , as the software said , you would have an idea of something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop to make the computer .
so no longer <unk> and <unk> or <unk> code , but just a metaphor .
now that made it a lot better , but of course it &apos;s much better .
the next generation of <unk> <unk> works very much more .
so i think that as a human being , i &apos;m very much more likely to behave behavior than that .
that &apos;s another paradigm .
that , suddenly , i suddenly look at this , and i suddenly think that this is successful for success , which is just going to be a disease .
and if i take a step back into these social interactions , where i am a voice , by language , by <unk> , by touch , and no longer <unk> the things , then i &apos;m faster and more .
but that brings me back to the point , when are things going on ?
and then when you get bored , and then i have to go back to my little friend here and see what does that mean , because what does this mean from the point of view , when is it really ?
and that &apos;s a little bit curious to us , if i have to think about it a little bit .
so apparently he doesn &apos;t like to think , but it &apos;s just changing .
the less i think about it , the more it is .
and what does that mean for designers ?
that means that if we look at the fact that we can transmit <unk> from one another to something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can do that as a <unk> .
that means i can transmit a <unk> , human <unk> on a software , and make the software make a difference .
and of course , the question of course , the question is , actually , that &apos;s the most important thing that humans and now i have .
this is what we call <unk> .
it uses every one of us and <unk> is an <unk> and stands for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
that &apos;s what everybody does all of you , but he makes it clear , and it &apos;s kind of intuitive , or partly <unk> .
and the model is already in the womb , and it &apos;s <unk> , so it works in young and old , and it &apos;s used by all of us without knowing that most people knew that this model is there .
<unk> <unk> is going to take about 50 to <unk> times from us ever to activity , so in sleep , it &apos;s less often <unk> than a day .
i can now use this mental <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> efficiency on a <unk> .
and through this kind of <unk> , similar to the metaphor of the <unk> , but now it &apos;s not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a <unk> , a <unk> .
and this is at a higher level of <unk> than a classic metaphor , which is the <unk> .
and if i look at this now , for example , in which i &apos;m <unk> as a <unk> , <unk> as a choice , <unk> in the event , i can look at it in detail , and i can look at it in detail , and yes , <unk> means i can also send it somewhere or somebody send somebody and sit and so forth .
then i can transmit the whole .
i &apos;m trying to do this through a <unk> .
in fact , everybody ate cake .
sw : now i &apos;m going to take this object , again , <unk> .
i &apos;ll get rid of all of it , can go back and say , just show me all the things with chocolate .
and what is far more natural and very natural .
because i can <unk> things like this , and it can come back to me is far more natural than if you &apos;re talking about <unk> websites , or other mechanisms , you can see these things available .
turns out to be <unk> <unk> <unk> , and with that sentence , i &apos;d like to close too , a a little bit to give the evidence , too , designers have to think differently to come to new solutions , and in that sense , i thank you right for your attention and please .
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first thing , if you &apos;re a child as a child , is that you &apos;re going to take care of what you have like this , right ? and depending on whether your parents allowed them to play more or less in the <unk> , the more , you know , their curiosity , of course .
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
so all of you who are and curious are actually people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m about to measure all of this <unk> , <unk> , <unk> years of <unk> , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point there .
and it depends on phosphorus .
give me a chance .
every day you &apos;re going to spend about two gram phosphorus , and every day you have to take two gram of phosphorus .
you can &apos;t have teeth else .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bones .
we could only <unk> <unk> through the <unk> .
in fact , if we don &apos;t have phosphorus and <unk> .
so what &apos;s amazing is that we &apos;re going to have to do something about it , which is kind of ugly , but it &apos;s not that way .
because everybody talks about energy , but nobody talks about the <unk> .
<unk> is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we &apos;ve only put phosphorus for two years , and now , by the way , around the world , there will be much more <unk> into the environment than it is used in all scales .
in the last 20 years alone , <unk> tons of <unk> have been distributed into germany .
and we take that .
it &apos;s done in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less <unk> .
so for example , <unk> the environment , the less car .
<unk> the environment , make less waste .
<unk> the environment , <unk> less energy .
that &apos;s not protection .
that &apos;s the way i would say , <unk> your child , only three times five times .
that &apos;s just a little less destruction .
if we think about this from <unk> to the <unk> , our entire earth will last back or later .
and that &apos;s why we think about <unk> .
and the most important thing we &apos;re looking at is looking at the ground .
in the ground , over <unk> percent of the <unk> is <unk> .
at the moment , we &apos;re building corn , and we lose between 11 and 30 pounds of <unk> tons per square meter , or the square square .
that is , we lose losing the ground for about three times more than new .
of course , we can look at the <unk> .
and everything is weird or content .
for example , in <unk> , 20 percent of the <unk> is <unk> .
and because we get older , they get bigger .
they &apos;re all in <unk> .
yes ?
a baby takes about six pounds .
of course we could reduce that by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this is going to be used in china in a second .
this is completely <unk> .
so the question is , how do we deal with these ?
here &apos;s one of the evidence that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is associated with pigs at pigs .
people over the urine .
yeah .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s yes , right ?
we think we think in <unk> , we &apos;re too many in the world .
and when you tell people , if you say , if you say it &apos;s better , you &apos;re not going to be there , then you &apos;re going to be <unk> and <unk> .
and so somebody like al gore , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing more <unk> than to stabilize human population .
in israel , when you say you &apos;re a person , you &apos;re <unk> the earth .
here , the more you say , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , the ants are about four times more than we humans .
i could also get rid of it , but in the united states , no one ever seen in the united states , even though they &apos;re <unk> .
that means the ants are much more than us .
and it &apos;s because they &apos;re physically working much harder than we do , and because they only live three to six months , they are in their weight , in the energy consumption , a little bit of 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
and where you see how far we get away from what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , we &apos;re at all on earth , you can see that , for example , a program has a program to be <unk> , right ?
you can only be <unk> if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only chance .
have you seen a <unk> tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that is , our whole intelligence means that we want to be <unk> as trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is <unk> .
happiness isn &apos;t , yes ?
there &apos;s no <unk> on trees .
there are still <unk> billion trees alone .
you &apos;ve heard about trees from trees already ?
that means that all of our intelligence means that we want to be trees as trees .
and where you see , even in something like <unk> , the <unk> <unk> is not allowed our own <unk> .
every year , we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really needed to go back .
and we &apos;re too many .
just over that .
that means we feel so guilty about the earth that we say . there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and all the hot ones that allow our own <unk> .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
we are too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less useful , which is available .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to draw our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big deal that &apos;s useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for economics , but when it comes to the environment , is the highest , not there , yes ?
<unk> , yes ?
you can only have <unk> if you &apos;re not there .
even if you went to bed , you would have emissions .
so they can &apos;t solve this .
we can do it differently .
we can <unk> our nutrients .
we do in brazil agriculture in which we put nutrients .
right now , we can <unk> nutrients this way in agriculture .
we do this in china , for example , where we take the wavelength of it .
in china , a <unk> is still <unk> , right ?
and in our western world we were always stupid , our nutrients .
that means that the entire western <unk> is always taken by the city , but the farmers never had anything .
and so the cities had to grow more and more , because the farmers went into the cities and the cities still needed to get their nutrients .
that &apos;s why all the western rich are always isolated , until they have no infrastructure , and then they &apos;re <unk> .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done <unk> civilization over <unk> years because you were always able to get nutrients .
even today , if you were invited to dinner in china , you &apos;re expecting to stay as long as you stay the toilet .
because it &apos;s <unk> to go and bring nutrients .
you &apos;ve invited them to dinner , not to <unk> .
that means you can see the nutrients on the internet .
actually , the nice thing about this is , if you do this , agriculture does agriculture , it &apos;s produced , on a <unk> country with <unk> people in favelas , so that a farmer can be about <unk> dollars , and they &apos;re going to wait for it , chickens and pig grow and vegetables and fish and fish and fish .
and the great thing about this is that the <unk> rate in the favelas is over <unk> percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control the people .
we can support them being good .
this is <unk> , of course , but they &apos;re wearing themselves .
the heat is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by the design that a farmer can just <unk> them .
so go back to <unk> .
and none of these industries , we have been built over the last 20 years , none of these have ever been <unk> .
they could easily do this easily a <unk> , and then it would be over years .
it doesn &apos;t happen .
that means we don &apos;t have to control the people .
we can support them being good .
that means we need to <unk> phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want , you write in germany , in germany , best , of all <unk> .
unfortunately , not in <unk> , but maybe you can do a little bit of help .
because the <unk> plant could be best <unk> the phosphorus .
and it has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it works right .
we have used over three years now .
the federal government explains you will be the first country in the world , which is phosphorus .
but we need that whole .
understand , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s population .
there &apos;s a bunch of <unk> .
these are <unk> countries that control 40 percent of the <unk> control .
and the oil will replace us through others .
but you can &apos;t replace the phosphorus .
that &apos;s not about making money a little less bad , but it &apos;s about doing something right .
and most importantly , to ask what the right thing is .
that is , it &apos;s efficiency , not about efficiency .
in fact , you understand that easier , of course , because in copenhagen , the country is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if you have your wife sad , for example , if you have it , and you come in with 50 <unk> .
completely <unk> .
but quite effective , yes ?
or take a <unk> .
a woman in germany eats about six inches during her life .
here .
this is not scientifically accurate precisely because we don &apos;t know how much <unk> it is .
but it &apos;s a <unk> , even with that lighting , i can tell you , is completely uncomfortable , but it &apos;s all effective , right ?
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s not increasing , but efficiency .
ask , what is the right thing ?
not to burn the <unk> a little bit better , and to lose it and to lose the whole materials all the materials , but first to ask , how do you move ?
imagine mozart efficient .
yes ?
if i take you to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with <unk> and a glass of water .
wonderful , &apos; huh ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
do you fall in love with somebody ?
yes ?
that means everything that matters in life is not about saving .
all the <unk> .
we tell people , oh yeah , you &apos;re not in the south .
no , it &apos;s exactly the right thing , right ?
in every place where you live , from , yes , you create <unk> .
but the wrong thing .
if you <unk> the wrong stuff , you have a <unk> .
we think of north .
there &apos;s every footprint there .
if you walk , yeah , you lose the ground .
because the soil is going to die and the wind and the water <unk> the ground .
but if you &apos;re in italy , everyone in terms of the water means longer , the water remains longer .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big deal that is going to be <unk> .
not <unk> .
we say in germany sustainability .
yes ?
but if i ask you , how about your wife &apos;s like this ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , <unk> <unk> , yes ?
that &apos;s right now .
so don &apos;t save , <unk> , avoid .
everybody waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s a shame when you see people in italy , like the people in the high bow , like the <unk> <unk> .
because , you know , it &apos;s a <unk> process .
it &apos;s kind of like <unk> , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
so for example , we developed a <unk> , which is actually liquid in temperature .
they can <unk> where they go and stand .
in two hours , they build it everywhere .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that it leads to biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less <unk> .
so it &apos;s two <unk> .
it &apos;s not all meant to be <unk> .
a television or a washing machine , they only use they &apos;re not using it .
just the things that <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , they have to be the way in biological systems .
things that are used to be used in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the <unk> , yes ?
quite direct advertising , not for the company &apos;s company , but for them now to help this company succeed .
because we don &apos;t do things anymore .
yes ?
so , when i go to the food and say , this is free , it doesn &apos;t help you .
no , we found what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so it &apos;s not like <unk> .
not <unk> .
but everything that &apos;s inside is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can go to the <unk> on the <unk> and the <unk> can be <unk> in biological .
all of it is <unk> .
and if we can do it , of course , of course , for nike , for nike , for nike and <unk> and all the <unk> .
and that &apos;s half all the <unk> around the world .
that &apos;s why you help me ask you guys .
hey , <unk> , are you really serious ?
because now they have twice the <unk> .
and i &apos;m not sure they &apos;re really <unk> .
so , help me a little bit .
but it goes .
yeah .
this is what just happened .
this is all about .
we can now make things like this , that if you zoom in , if you zoom in , you can communicate in biological .
technical is the same thing .
there &apos;s a direct <unk> .
this is the first ecological plate , actually , that &apos;s made into the cycle .
so again , in each store , you can <unk> things .
if you come to that , yes ?
do you remember the <unk> ?
when it &apos;s right now , the waste .
all around the world are <unk> , almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
there you go , but else in the landscape , yeah ?
if we change the plastics so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the <unk> , inside that you can actually go back to <unk> , then you can plant in israel with a baby in israel or tunisia .
yes ?
by the way , if you take these <unk> , you <unk> , <unk> and the powder to plant trees .
this is the baby &apos;s baby for the whole life , from the beginning .
so we don &apos;t need to be <unk> ; we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s sort of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
yeah , sort of .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can still invent everything else .
i started a institute .
now there &apos;s a lot of people working there , and you can all get involved .
there &apos;s extra competition to work on where everyone can be done .
so no longer save , <unk> , avoid , not <unk> , but intelligent waste .
does it be curious ?
thank you .
the work of <unk> .
music as language .
in the description to my talk , i wrote that as a <unk> , <unk> , so in english , i understand .
<unk> are the famous notes in <unk> music .
that if you don &apos;t just say word for the text into a different language , but also to understand the deeper sense of words and <unk> to make it a useful translation , knows anyone who has to do with <unk> .
already from german to english , there can be more knowledge , if you &apos;re talking about poetry or even about poetry .
it &apos;s not very much what we do with our <unk> .
first of all , as a <unk> of a <unk> , first of all .
you might think that the <unk> has just <unk> everything that he would have .
in fact , grades are very <unk> and <unk> .
these notes are about the same or <unk> , like a <unk> , although very seemingly <unk> , description of a landscape .
because in this <unk> <unk> , the smell of flowers is not to smell , to stop the degree of the <unk> , the degree of the <unk> , not feeling too much .
that is , you have to put these <unk> <unk> into another , which is <unk> , concrete , <unk> <unk> .
today , i want to show you what i else else , so <unk> , even in a <unk> language .
so basically , a translation of translation .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m afraid to do it in italy , because if i had to translate it back to english , it would be to me for me with translation of the translation of translation .
so , the music works for me as much as the spoken language .
the <unk> notes have the function of a writing .
so it &apos;s not enough to read just notes , and to press it to the piano or to press the right place on a <unk> .
that would be just the letters you learned to paint .
the details of the letters is only when you can do language .
so you need at least as long as i did for the spoken language .
and then there &apos;s also <unk> , whether you learn it for <unk> , you can only understand practical , or you can speak to the musical <unk> .
the work of <unk> starts similar to like a <unk> .
once you start playing a piece , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re looking for <unk> of the origins of the atmosphere .
you collect information about the piece in <unk> .
you read in the letters , <unk> , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts from the composer itself .
you study the work he did before and after .
you think of it .
the invitation to write it .
how did he feel ?
how were his ancestors , like the society and politics ?
that &apos;s all i &apos;m interested in .
you think of it in time by looking for example , looking at contemporary images or literature .
but over time , you also have a rich knowledge as well as a professional knowledge that you play and it &apos;s always easier to feel in it and feel you .
it &apos;s becoming more like the friend that you live with .
being able to write the piece , more and more and more to my personal mind , to play it .
now the notes are all other than a very precise record of the <unk> , but just a framework , i &apos;m looking at this framework to make it sense again and meaning .
and i say to my own words , what could be written between this framework .
i play <unk> that could mean that sound .
now , for me , and what you might mean now for him today .
every sound , each piece gets a sense because i &apos;m feeling it myself , because it <unk> from my right now .
it has to be for me here and now i can &apos;t convince my audience that this is my cause .
and again , it &apos;s a very happy concert , if i may have the experience that i &apos;ve been able to do so long in advance how new to experience .
how do you experience a happy new day , even though the same amount of life , up with the same amount of life , up to the work , go to work , as well as i do the same piece over again .
i &apos;ve become a day , again , changing independence , my heart goes down at night , and it takes longer to make the sound back at home .
i take the sound of the audience , consciously consciously or touch .
all of this affects me , and all that affects my experience as well .
quite wonderful , when i stand on stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , <unk> conversation .
you get a new idea in it , and there &apos;s a new idea in it , and there &apos;s a reaction to it .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things that we don &apos;t have so much and what you can &apos;t do .
it &apos;s great fun to make music in this way , and as the audience have experienced the music alive .
so each concert is another concert .
i will never play more like that moment .
i can &apos;t play that way today in 20 years .
because i &apos;m going to have more and more more than today than today , and i &apos;m going to focus on my own level of education , much more <unk> , of emotions and emotions than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some <unk> , but i &apos;m going to have some <unk> .
have a nice example of that .
it was on a <unk> for <unk> at my beloved old teacher , professor <unk> <unk> , a famous <unk> , <unk> professor here in <unk> .
unfortunately , i was still too young , so that he was <unk> when i finally started studying .
but i was lucky , it was very early , when i was 15 years old , i was on his own <unk> .
i was 17 at that time when i was back on one of his courses , and i played the last one of the four <unk> of <unk> , a <unk> .
he asked me what was the following of these <unk> for me .
this is such a <unk> part .
and in my talk , i said depressed .
there he and he said , like this ?
this must be the <unk> .
because for me , it means memory .
he was talking about atlanta .
well , with 17 , you still have dreams , but no major memories .
i play this piece of every couple of years today , and it &apos;s still <unk> for me , even though no one has changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , and again , i read something new .
one example , in a very different area , has painted the <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> light .
he translated the <unk> <unk> , as he saw it , as he saw it in that moment .
his personal <unk> of <unk> .
the <unk> interpretation of a piece is the same .
now , i &apos;m also older than <unk> , when he wrote the piece .
he lived only <unk> years .
and it &apos;s important to me to look back in the notes , even though i mean , you know .
to keep <unk> , right with the ipad .
because the notes are the only connection to him directly .
especially if he died already .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
i said yes , you need about just as long as the spoken language .
often , the <unk> is the fact that you just learn the notes .
you actually learn to read that before you just speak a word .
you learn to find the sounds of the notes on the instrument .
if all the fingers in time and right , like this in the notes , they come up with sounds like music .
when that hits happens , the student gets the <unk> piece .
now , interpretation is not talking about <unk> .
all right , so this is a quick piece .
<unk> , slowly .
loud and <unk> , r and b , etc .
most of you here know .
but even if you put those together , it still remains a little bit more technical .
and yet , it &apos;s always not interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that a lot of a lot of the work is happening .
which is that , in order to make music on the instrument that you have your musical musical , and you should feel about it before .
that &apos;s what singing .
a child who didn &apos;t learn the singing , because it doesn &apos;t have parents , it won &apos;t do it .
this is like <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and an idea of music , and then there &apos;s another way of bringing about an instrument .
people who have never been married , never <unk> with your body , as it is to form a sound .
play with its own breath .
the instrument is to be the expansion of our body .
our patience to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the <unk> on the piano are my fingers .
the melody comes out of the <unk> and the rhythm .
the <unk> <unk> today is not <unk> .
you don &apos;t need to make music even if it &apos;s boring .
no longer need to shoot a <unk> or sing .
each of your music is <unk> when you get close from outside with music .
sure , there are some of you who say yes , but what do you do when i just don &apos;t sing ?
that &apos;s me , can &apos;t you sing , a , because you think you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
in both of them , it &apos;s not too late to see if they can &apos;t yet , or learn how to muscles those little muscles that make the equations .
you can train that .
or c , because they told them they &apos;re <unk> .
and then i ask , how <unk> was this diagnosis ?
do you have a <unk> or a <unk> , as you say , beautiful ?
or d , they don &apos;t like music , and therefore , they don &apos;t want music to do with it .
but what i would regret , because music is a beautiful , <unk> thing .
but maybe you can also <unk> them .
well , so you can see , there must be no one on all cases .
but don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t know anything about classical music .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
there i am , but surely you can tell if they like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it says somebody , i don &apos;t know if i can cook , because i can &apos;t cook .
so , they didn &apos;t eat the food , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to do classical music because they don &apos;t play instrument .
listen to them and tell if they don &apos;t care or not .
whether or not that music is too sweet to them or sweet .
tell what they feel .
now , over time , you also get <unk> , and you want to make a little bit more <unk> out there or taste even beautiful differences .
why am i asking from my audience that it &apos;s also active ?
because music is a language and a language to communicate .
a piece you never look at has no force .
the food that &apos;s been raped by a chicken or a chicken , has to be eaten , and not just looked at <unk> .
so if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice <unk> .
if you hear an adult where adults are active music , or at least active music , a child dies , then it &apos;s very easy for you to ask , you know , what color has your flower ?
can you also play it in blue now ?
and the child plays , after a <unk> , instead of having a blue flower now .
and this sounds very different than before .
that was the first beginning of a own musical expression .
so the first step to an interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today that was originally written a hundred ago ago or even ago ago ?
meanwhile , the instruments have <unk> .
there was no piano at the time as an instrument .
it wasn &apos;t invented yet .
i think it would have been thrilled if he would have had the most important opportunity in modern language today .
i can tell you the <unk> that the site has had , on the modern wing , on the modern wing to sound , which isn &apos;t capable of <unk> .
and you know , from beethoven , you know that he heard more than he had died .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything that a orchestra at the time was <unk> .
that &apos;s why the festivals are focused on us that make the pieces again .
so that &apos;s what you &apos;ll only have in the mind .
and also , what you would think of today in the mind .
or what i &apos;m looking for today , because what you thought might have been .
thank you .
you know what ?
have you been <unk> ?
and how did that feel ?
<unk> .
i have a friend who drives a <unk> .
and then when i come back with my little <unk> , and i <unk> it next to me , comes this feeling .
i got something through the head .
i say , <unk> , what do you need &apos; n big car ?
that &apos;s the first year half of his <unk> .
and at all , you &apos;re much less than me .
why do i afford to afford n little car ?
and then immediately , it falls to me immediately .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , this strange feeling .
our organism has invented a great way to get these kinds of emotions feelings just to disappear .
you can also try it with words like <unk> or <unk> or <unk> .
so i want to explain to you with this mechanism today , or something that you &apos;re probably familiar with .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but don &apos;t think about the lie , as you may have heard , when people say nobody has a wall .
and then <unk> <unk> so he gave them the view .
in such a lie , you can see that the self doesn &apos;t believe what he says .
it &apos;s easy to realize that it &apos;s all in mind .
he &apos;s just like her and not himself .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about , it has to do with it .
you need that lie to preserve a <unk> .
they can make them less easily , yes , <unk> or <unk> .
you need time .
so from that time , an anecdote that you may know .
the spanish painter <unk> once killed a woman .
this woman turned on then , the portrait wouldn &apos;t see her .
picasso says , wait .
it will always be similar to you .
at this point , when you laugh , you realize how important this lie is and how much time you need to know something that artists very well can tell us .
because artists have a <unk> relationship to lie .
artist tells you something , and most of all this lady , what you don &apos;t see when you just look in the mirror .
the artist shares you in such a portrait of something that you first familiar with when you look at this piece over and over again .
and then that weird sense , it may not be similar to you , and it will always be similar to you .
so here you have this mechanism where we can use the lie as a great invention for our <unk> .
and not only in art , also in the <unk> , in the mythology , in stories .
you may know this idea of lady who looked every morning in the mirror and asked him , who is the most beautiful all over the country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a <unk> .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much <unk> from this true <unk> , the mirror can &apos;t lie from that true <unk> .
but we should just be familiar with that one woman can &apos;t tell you that there &apos;s a <unk> somewhere else .
here &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to understand under <unk> <unk> .
what we need in this place is this lie that shows us the deception without which we can &apos;t .
we have not only in art , in <unk> , but also in science such great lie .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman &apos;s wife of <unk> .
she heard about charles darwin &apos;s book , the origin of species and the absence of man .
that the person should take off the monkeys , yes , there were a common ancestor between humans and monkeys .
and then she ran her to her husband and said , well , that &apos;s not true what charles was writing .
man would have a common ancestor or a common ancestor .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to prevent people from that .
why do we stop human beings from something if it &apos;s true ?
because without these <unk> can &apos;t live .
because we have this <unk> , this feeling of great , from the highest creatures , not from such a kind of <unk> , of something like a organism that exists , which exists in a stone , and whatever else it is for us .
so , we can &apos;t fix those things .
we need to prevent people from things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you can see the slow slowly of this mechanism and what the traces look like , which lead to something different than this great image of ourselves , i want to share with you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , i mean .
my wife told me .
she came from school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told me about a student .
a <unk> student .
she likes to enjoy him very much because he &apos;s got a tendency to change .
and she asked him , what are your <unk> ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at fire .
and because i &apos;m in fire , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
yeah , you feel it when you &apos;re <unk> at this point , there &apos;s something wrong .
i told my wife whenever a human being used to do this because they &apos;re used , we should try to replace it even though we could replace them .
do that once , and then you experience the sentence .
although i &apos;m in fire , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
you feel , that &apos;s the actual truth behind it .
that &apos;s a little <unk> that doesn &apos;t care about <unk> .
they &apos;re interested in <unk> .
but there &apos;s no way that we can look at where you learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s only the news , just the fire .
there he was .
and <unk> , you also don &apos;t tell your teacher that you &apos;d like to go somewhere and feel comfortable when the fire comes back .
no , it &apos;s just a lot better when we show that we are in charge of making the risks that others can do when they put fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
and this <unk> that , in the <unk> , knew that it was actually associated with fire , but he can &apos;t say that loud .
here you have this <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk> , which is immediately <unk> , without having to do something about it , and the things that you know is that it looks so much better for you and others .
and then just that words , the words that we use in the political process , we &apos;re using it again and again .
we actually know that something else is the case .
but we know when we see that , the social data are very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to present those things in a society that should work .
i want to show you now what we found in my institute .
what logic is this deception , this <unk> , the willingness , a different reality than the one that we actually know already in the sky , that it &apos;s limited to spread .
i want to tell you two , maybe three examples .
the first example indicates that many of you know , and some of you may not need , very few of you .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is such a thing , says <unk> .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not <unk> , natural nature .
and if you have people who are useful , they have a soul , or you can say that they &apos;ve had a soul from the soul to life , that it would be so much like the soul about them , not out of matter ; they &apos;re just coming out of meat and blood , something kind of <unk> , <unk> to the earth , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and from that soul , you think that somehow in this <unk> nature , in this <unk> nature , is called it in the latin , the <unk> .
and as this result then <unk> over human beings , it &apos;s filled with dignity , with nature , with nature that can only live , yes with soul .
and then he can <unk> .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
so it &apos;s meant to get rid of the outside .
so we should perceive them as something that is necessarily important to our lives .
and if you have this irony in front of your eyes , you understand the logic with which we experience this happiness , by a lie of our world .
because now you can use a <unk> .
<unk> do you know from school .
this is a <unk> that describes us a logic .
that &apos;s the most exciting part in my talk .
here you need something logic , but also lies .
so to lie , you can just apply this logic wrong .
in this <unk> , three sentences .
the first sentence is , <unk> says , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if he &apos;s right , he has no soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i particularly met him especially .
third sentence , which immediately looks at people who have a strong sense of soul .
they say , who has no soul , who &apos;s dead , cannot say nothing .
and here you feel it already .
here &apos;s the logic here , yes , in this <unk> talk .
you can see it immediately .
the first two sentences that are logical correct .
i can say everything .
logic doesn &apos;t make a story about reality .
i can say the <unk> is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , the <unk> is a man .
if i &apos;m not right , there &apos;s no man .
logic doesn &apos;t make a statement about what &apos;s true .
i can say everything .
but critical , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so if <unk> says there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he has no soul .
these things are logical correct .
and now your <unk> consciousness immediately , you can do something .
it &apos;s a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s what it does , as if the opposite of the first sentence has already been proven and <unk> .
because actually , we should prove if there is a soul or not .
but with this logic that it just uses that two sentences are accurate correctly , and a third <unk> that looks like it has to do with it , so we can save our <unk> .
so , we pretend to be able to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
we can tell these things to different examples .
in the present perspective , we have a very modern example , and again , again , the <unk> .
now , you have to talk about another <unk> subject , a <unk> from philosophy .
this has to do with the fact that we go back to the <unk> century .
there was a biologist who was named mike <unk> , and after that is the <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s not that soul .
this is such a <unk> .
and if you put it in the middle between two <unk> <unk> , it <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know what to go first .
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
this is the <unk> conference .
<unk> forces : solve each other .
there &apos;s nothing at all .
only if you bring another example , so if you immediately make a difference immediately , it doesn &apos;t need any reason , and nothing else .
automatically goes to the right mind .
so , if you have this idea that you &apos;re sort of being driven in nature , you &apos;re going to be <unk> by the larger pile that you put in , you too quickly feel like there &apos;s something like a free will .
and if we &apos;re already in <unk> at the <unk> , i remember the <unk> for <unk> .
there is a biologist called <unk> <unk> , and he &apos;s telling you , sometimes <unk> says , there &apos;s no <unk> .
now again , we can form the second sentence , and can say , if <unk> has right , he doesn &apos;t have any <unk> .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can read in the reading every day that you &apos;ll find in this third sentence .
it looks something like this , who has no <unk> , can &apos;t be pulled for its actions and claims for responsibility , and it &apos;s therefore <unk> .
again , you have it again .
in fact , you have to see if there &apos;s such a thing as <unk> .
but the logic of deception allows us to do this as if the first sentence was wrong , as if you had to say the opposite without evidence .
and now you can just , if you want anything to make yourself anything , if you want to test yourself anything , and especially if you want to make people happy , that courage practice .
for example , if you meet a person who you can say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for <unk> , which is <unk> .
they &apos;re not allowed to call it , this would be a little politically again .
say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
immediately , you &apos;re going to have one in which there &apos;s granted like this , you know , you know .
and already , you have a problem .
because while you &apos;re busy , you can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no <unk> , is the man quite happy .
he &apos;s quite happy about it because he has <unk> them .
because he led them to a <unk> that he doesn &apos;t even remember himself .
because actually , this person is not interested in evidence .
he &apos;s only interested in remembering himself in front of the need to prove that there &apos;s <unk> .
so , in the kind of climate change , they experience the <unk> of the lie .
and once again , once you have an opportunity to feel like other people , do it , because they will make others happy if they don &apos;t remember them in that way .
thank you for your attention .
yes , good day .
i gave myself a question to ask if i could mention them .
she &apos;s one of the <unk> here of this great event , and asked me if i &apos;m going to hold a talk here and my idea .
i have to tell you , you know , you know , i noticed hard to talk about my idea .
and i may be my <unk> imagine that i try to imagine you .
but of course , the sum is very , very many ideas .
i probably &apos;m probably going to be here , the two nice girls are still there , i &apos;m probably going to be at the generation of this bad <unk> image , because i &apos;ve already started studying research in <unk> , technical school , today , i think , today .
and i then went to berlin &apos;s center in berlin , because i wanted to do renewable energy , and i didn &apos;t have it in <unk> .
there were <unk> <unk> .
they were all <unk> , including the <unk> named <unk> .
it &apos;s called <unk> today .
because a good engineer is built either cars or <unk> .
but like n <unk> , out of a hundred watts from the square , that was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy <unk> .
i &apos;m grateful that he <unk> the word again because after the <unk> , you couldn &apos;t use the word anymore , because everything left was bad .
however , that was not like the <unk> .
it was like there was <unk> <unk> , and one of them was sitting in <unk> in <unk> , where you were doing evil .
but it was called <unk> , and it was called <unk> , and it &apos;s made wind , and i started in the middle of the shanghai .
and yes , a lot of what &apos;s said today , i &apos;m really excited about this because a lot , a lot of beautiful conversations were there , that i &apos;ve lived on .
i worked in the process for 11 years , which was <unk> .
we were 20 people .
if one has said no , it was the <unk> , it &apos;s totally <unk> . i &apos;ve been hard for 10 years , i &apos;ve been hard to think about whether i was really interested in a <unk> thing , because all of my father &apos;s colleagues always told him , you &apos;ve got the money back to your child .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and this was really , very , very <unk> , and you come in like this , and this is a picture of a <unk> , where i asked myself about 10 years , thousands of <unk> , who were still , <unk> , <unk> , of course , could be the great thing .
and i then left it to <unk> , and then we got together with friends , i grew up the company <unk> of one of the largest <unk> in the world .
we have a <unk> problem , of course , but also that we have the problem of a growing company , and we then have <unk> , a small group , decided that we start to start small again and then go back and talk to the next theme of the future , and i think that means it &apos;s kind of crazy , it &apos;s kind of crazy , that &apos;s when people say what &apos;s wrong , we &apos;re talking about store .
and i &apos;ve taken a project to show you a project .
and the title of the talk was , you know , you get to a hundred percent renewable .
and we just started asking a relatively <unk> story , where could you use a memory today .
on this island , this is the island of <unk> on the <unk> .
yeah , that &apos;s the data .
there are four thousand people living .
they now have renewables of 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
it just doesn &apos;t work .
if you add more <unk> each other , the system starts to fail .
i &apos;m also telling you that as well as the politicians in <unk> our facility .
they always say why ?
we &apos;ve had 20 percent in germany .
can &apos;t be a problem .
but it &apos;s not true , we &apos;ve seven percent , in europe , seven percent .
if we had one percent in europe , we &apos;d have the same problems that people have on this island .
and the question was simple , which was <unk> , first of all started with the island , but just as a result .
how big would it be to actually be a battery so that you have this battery on 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe 70 percent renewable .
and yes , i &apos;m going to go on a <unk> .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , about a hundred years of electric power is on <unk> <unk> in the world .
that &apos;s the equivalent of a hundred nuclear gas , especially fast everywhere .
the <unk> of the world , which is happening , is going to be <unk> , because you don &apos;t need any air .
this goes fast .
you look like this .
and then it looks like this .
in the end , three and three , they are always waiting .
yeah , this is what it looks like on the bottom .
we also get very precise data .
and the <unk> , or the <unk> , or whatever it is , is that the rule a system of system is like a system , which is only in small quantities here .
our goal was to just say , okay .
the <unk> is called the wind and the wind , the use of the sun , so that it can transform the larger proportion .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewables , so energy per year , not the performance at the moment , then you have to get rid of the <unk> .
that is , in the moment you have to make sure that renewables can take the entire grid of energy .
of course , you can only , of course , if you &apos;re <unk> in any way .
nobody has done that in the world .
there &apos;s it in a little bit of style , so you can also put your <unk> on a little <unk> .
people are always asking me , what are you doing ?
this is already .
but if you want several of these <unk> , and you want to build a net , it becomes extremely complicated .
and our goal was that we wanted to come up to <unk> percent renewable , and then there &apos;s this rest , the last 10 , 20 percent rate , which is going to be very , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work that you make it out of batteries .
this will be a distinction , then , hydrogen , methane , electricity to gas , you know , it will be .
then you have to go to a <unk> and <unk> and not just <unk> .
we just wanted to know what happened with a normal , <unk> battery battery .
how far do you ever get there ?
and then there &apos;s a whole bunch of apples .
and the wind and the sun and the burden of all the time and came to the result , a very surprising result , that you have to go to the conventional system , which after 20 years , you know , <unk> from about 50 cents a <unk> , about <unk> cents .
these were the first calculations that were six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
yeah , we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper like the <unk> , if you get five percent per year .
and then we started using the <unk> .
what should all be done ?
with investors , i &apos;ve looked at new <unk> .
we were only five people at the time to build a society .
and here again the picture .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green system is our system .
that our system also has a <unk> , because we still do 20 percent with <unk> , and we don &apos;t <unk> on the other things .
and the <unk> that the <unk> on the island has meant that we &apos;re great .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin where we can see the electrical <unk> of the island in scale to three very precisely .
that means we then look looking at the largest battery in the world .
here it is .
this comes from asia , in the case of japan .
and <unk> , it &apos;s been developed in the &apos; 80s , today , today , developed , and then became <unk> to the japanese .
it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
it has an advanced performance , and it can bring that performance for six hours , and that &apos;s the battery that we kind of <unk> .
and then they set out .
we also have one of these <unk> in the same size , as it says , into the hall , to actually behave the full dynamic behavior of this web , so in the hall , it looks like this , as it &apos;s in the back here , there &apos;s the big battery , there &apos;s the whole battery here that we can simulate the net .
over here , we simulate the entire <unk> , the <unk> of the cable to sort of <unk> the <unk> in the net .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we can also <unk> <unk> <unk> on the net .
so here &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing again , again , the <unk> here , again , the whole , single <unk> .
and what we &apos;ve done since then was the apple finished , until today , basically everything that was building between the individual systems of electronics to develop software , we did .
so we &apos;re not <unk> , but we define as a company that &apos;s only between the subject and the subject and everything in between .
you &apos;ve got to communicate , of course , to communicate in the web , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the nice thing is , you know , on this island , you can basically do everything that you can get in problems that we &apos;re going to get when we want to increase our share of renewables .
so this whole discussion of how is going to go back and forth right now , <unk> , how this is supposed to go , on the island , for example , for <unk> to 30 percent , so we <unk> the wind and the sun .
<unk> is then <unk> .
so <unk> , a <unk> everywhere .
we can just start in the island for the island , so that we can start with <unk> , <unk> , you can do the burden .
that means that if you &apos;re at low percent renewable , you can &apos;t do that without memory .
you can never get through &apos; n , you can go through <unk> , yes , you should never do it , but you can never <unk> on memory .
and that &apos;s the n .
so many people come and look at this , because you can see what problems you get .
if we <unk> the <unk> , you don &apos;t really have that <unk> mass that causes a certain decline in the net .
and our <unk> system , basically , is only made of <unk> amounts of large <unk> , where the wave is everywhere around europe .
we &apos;re looking at this grid in this grid , and you &apos;ll see the 50 rains , and if it &apos;s going to add to nine degrees , we &apos;ll start with a few <unk> , and then we go back a little bit of <unk> , we &apos;ll come back up .
this is the system .
and of course , this is incredibly painful .
if you do that somewhere , it takes a while .
there &apos;s at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and over time , you can react again .
if they don &apos;t have that anymore , they have to replace it with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can <unk> with this big battery two genomes once .
and then you can see which enormous <unk> there are .
and the message is now , we &apos;ve got to go to these <unk> units , if we say our goals 20 , 20 percent , 20 percent , 30 , 30 percent , and so on , if we want to reach at all .
then we have to cut our <unk> capacity on the net .
<unk> is simply taking the power to keep the frequency .
yeah , that &apos;s a <unk> moment at the moment , <unk> of <unk> , because we don &apos;t otherwise , or <unk> , because it &apos;s not .
and what we &apos;re just trying to do is just make sure that you can <unk> the capacity , you can break around , you can get your memory into the web .
now , there are a lot of studies now .
and at that point , people would come and look at our <unk> on the top of our <unk> .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far you can get a piece of far future .
and a lot of discussions that i &apos;ve had in the last six years was similar to the discussion i &apos;ve had in the last 30 years .
it &apos;s not <unk> , <unk> , we have <unk> everything , never .
we now have <unk> <unk> in germany today .
this is <unk> .
and i &apos;m just going to just leave that in the next 30 years , we will be able to store the same capacity of <unk> all over the world .
it &apos;s easy .
there will be a whole bunch of <unk> and <unk> .
the nice thing is , i &apos;ve just experienced over the last two years that scientists are focusing on my side .
we &apos;ve got over 10 million dollars now in order to <unk> the <unk> net now .
this will be in the next april .
so , you know , you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s just about to say , you know , the idea , a hundred percent renewable renewable .
and if you have 100 percent renewable , that &apos;s like a <unk> system .
so far , what &apos;s been trying to do in discussions is to try to get those <unk> that make up , they have a little web that has nothing to do with our <unk> .
and the question is , quite simple , if you don &apos;t care about some fossil fossil or <unk> <unk> that are somewhere in the world and become <unk> , you know , you &apos;re a island .
then they only use what &apos;s in the sun and wind where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a <unk> , and i &apos;m also grateful that they said solar use .
and that &apos;s exactly what we do , and what we do , the talk from <unk> <unk> , that you can be able to use a collective and use energy , a little bit together .
and yeah , i just want to encourage you , in the sense that you can still be a little crazy and have a vision .
and you really have to stay pretty comfortable with it , but i think it &apos;s going to go .
thank you .
as steve <unk> , the los angeles times , one day through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , who was playing on a violin that was only two .
a lot of you will know the story , because of <unk> &apos;s articles later , a book that became <unk> , with robert <unk> , as steve <unk> and jamie <unk> , as a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , who was at <unk> studied and whose <unk> career early early on .
nathaniel left 1999 , a <unk> and 30 years later , he lived on the streets of <unk> mountains at the center of los angeles .
i assure all of you to read <unk> &apos;s book , or look at the film , so you can &apos;t just understand the wonderful imagination that came between these two men , but also how the music made this connection , and how it ended up with the instrument , if this recipe is allowed to get rid of the <unk> , quiet away from the street .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 two years ago in the arab disney <unk> hall .
he &apos;d heard about a show of ben first and fourth french and came behind the stage to imagine myself .
he was talking in a very <unk> and <unk> tone about <unk> and <unk> clinton , and about how the police could never create into the baseball world , and all of this because of the most popular history of the first sentence in the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s <unk> .
we got to talk to music , and a few days later , i got an email in which i was in the name that i was interested in <unk> .
i have to mention that medical treatment is a medical treatment , because he had already been treated with <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , a critic that has led him all his life .
now , as a result of this , he &apos;s particularly vulnerable to these ancient stages , and they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and he &apos;s walking away in the streets of <unk> <unk> , who <unk> and <unk> his own mind .
and in fact , in the same way that this was <unk> , when we started with our first group at the monterey disney hall hall , he had started this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and completely lost .
he talked about invisible <unk> and smoke and how somebody wanted him in sleep .
i was scared , not <unk> , but i was afraid i could lose him that he could put him in one of his states , and that i could destroy him in his relationship , when i started thinking about vulnerability and <unk> and other exciting forms of <unk> .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence by beethoven <unk> .
and while i was playing , there was a complete change in the eyes .
it was as if it was under the impact of a invisible war , a chemical reaction that was my game .
<unk> <unk> anger turned into understanding , into a quiet curiosity .
and like a miracle , he took his violin , and started looking for hearing some clips from <unk> , and then asked me to finish them at the end : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and then we started talking about music , starting from <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i realized that he was not just a <unk> knowledge about music , but it was a close personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding that i knew only from my colleagues in the middle of los angeles .
by having music playing music and about music , there was this <unk> , <unk> man who was still <unk> around the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> musicians .
music is medicine . music changes us .
<unk> means music of mental health .
because music allows him to express his thoughts and commitment with the help of his imagination and creativity into something real .
and so he <unk> his <unk> .
i understood that this is exactly the nature of art .
and that &apos;s why we make music : this is something that exists in all of us , deep inside , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity to reality .
and reality then has reached us all , moving , inspired , inspired us .
in fact , it brought him back into a community of friends .
the <unk> force of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him his talent .
and i &apos;m always going to take music again , whether in the <unk> disney <unk> hall or <unk> , because he reminds me of why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruce <unk> : thank you very much . thank you .
robert <unk> .
robert gupta : i &apos;d like to play something that i &apos;ve stolen <unk> .
i hope you &apos;re sorry .
so i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
i only have two loved .
this first one , which was more like a <unk> .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> .
what a fish .
even better , it was set up in <unk> after the popular standards of sustainability .
so you &apos;d feel comfortable to sell it .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
one day , the head of the company called and asked if i could make a event about sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company that tried to solve , which has become this powerful problem for our hypothesis , how do we keep fish in our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , the ocean has <unk> the ocean as we sent forests .
it &apos;s hard to <unk> the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so i think it &apos;s going to be <unk> , <unk> , part of our future .
a lot of arguments against it . <unk> <unk> the environment , most of you anyway , and you &apos;re very inefficient , let &apos;s take tuna . a big bang .
he &apos;s got a <unk> from 15 to one .
that is , 15 pounds <unk> are necessary so you get pounds .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t work very well .
so here was finally a company , trying to do it right .
i wanted to press it .
the day before the event , i called the head of <unk> for the company .
let &apos;s call it clear .
&quot; listen , &quot; i said , &quot; just to be right about the facts , you &apos;re famous for that , so far out in the sea , that you don &apos;t use the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we are so far out that the waste of our fish is distributed . &quot;
and then he put it , &quot; we &apos;re basically a own world .
this <unk> of <unk> to one , &quot; he said .
the best in industry . &quot;
one , great .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; what do you mean ? &quot;
sustainable proteins , he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put up .
and that night i was in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , just before the event , don &apos;t know .
i said , &quot; well , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to win .
well , i <unk> with some people in the company . no one could give me an answer . until i finally came up with the <unk> biologists .
let &apos;s call it a <unk> too .
&quot; listen , &quot; i said , &quot; what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , <unk> , skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of happiness is chicken ? &quot;
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; well , what &apos;s sustainable from getting chicken to fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i <unk> from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
that &apos;s me .
no , i actually <unk> out of this fish , because , i swear to god , who has fish after that conversation after chicken .
this second fish , which is a different kind of speech .
it &apos;s the romantic way you know , the way you ever learn your fish , you learn the fish more .
i first eaten it in a restaurant at first .
a <unk> journalist had talked about this fish for a long time .
she &apos;s kind of <unk> us .
he came up on the table with a light , almost white white color .
the chef had <unk> him .
stop twice .
and it was still delicious .
who can make a fish as well after he got <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it <unk> . in fact , it &apos;s <unk> .
and no , he doesn &apos;t have the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way that you and i can understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner .
she &apos;s near the <unk> of the river .
by the way , the farm was in the hands of <unk> .
they were <unk> <unk> on what they were basically .
they did that by <unk> the land .
they built this complicated set of telescopes , and they clean water out of the land and out into the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make the case , not economic .
and it was a disaster .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds in which these birds are many birds .
and so he bought a spanish company on the country .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of water .
they literally <unk> the phantom .
instead of using water , they used the water to <unk> the water .
they <unk> the water .
they created a <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- and in the process , <unk> and its company the ecological destruction completely <unk> .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
you zoom out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you see is <unk> water and that density , <unk> march .
i was there not a long time ago .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin , and a part , &quot; a penguin to the director . &quot;
okay ? there we were , and we were <unk> by the <unk> , and i <unk> and <unk> , up to my knees , and i hold up in silence a <unk> .
here he puts a rare <unk> .
now he was talking about <unk> .
and here , he &apos;s looking at a pattern of clay that reminds him of the <unk> .
it turns out that having spent most of his career in the <unk> park in africa .
i asked him how he became a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and moved into more ideas of rare birds and algae and strange <unk> .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , this was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community , like this .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head became weak over this <unk> piece that i had at <unk> .
so i bought him . i said , &quot; hey , how did your fish be so good ? &quot;
he showed the algae .
&quot; i know boy , the algae , the <unk> , the relationships , is incredible .
but what eat your fish ?
what &apos;s the <unk> ? &quot;
now , he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a rare system that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
the amount of biomass , the metabolism , the <unk> , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely <unk> .
there &apos;s no food .
ever from a farm that doesn &apos;t hear their animals ?
later on this site day , i was walking around this site , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place to be so natural , &quot; unlike any farm that i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; what do you succeed ? &quot;
at the moment , it was like a guy had to have a <unk> .
and we bow around the corner , and we set up the most amazing image , thousands of thousands and thousands of <unk> , literally , which is literally the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your <unk> , pink .
they <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; hey , don &apos;t you buy your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to birds .
now last year , on this site , birds , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s now the largest and most important private organization in europe .
i said , &quot; hey , is a good <unk> scientist not the last thing you want on a <unk> ? &quot;
he <unk> his head , no .
he said , &quot; we build <unk> , not hard .
this is a state network .
the <unk> eat the ball .
they eat the algae .
so the body means the better the system . &quot;
okay , so let &apos;s rethink this : a farm that <unk> her animals and a farm that affects their success in health .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , it shouldn &apos;t even be there .
she goes miles away in a city where the <unk> is better for <unk> .
every morning you fly to the farm .
and every night , they fly three miles back .
they do it because they can follow the <unk> white line of the <unk> .
seriously .
i had studied a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at it .
i said , &quot; hey , fly out to the farm and fly to the farm and fly miles back in the evening ?
are you doing that for the kids ? &quot;
and he looked at me as if i had just been <unk> a song by alice .
he said , &quot; no . you do it because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my father &apos;s skin , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like them <unk> . i don &apos;t like them .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste .
i never loved it .
and yet , when i tried her in this restaurant in <unk> , she didn &apos;t look for <unk> .
they liked sweet and <unk> like you &apos;d take a walk from the ocean .
i mentioned the other thing , and he <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a knife .
she &apos;s the last century before something in the body .
it &apos;s developing evolution in terms of <unk> . &quot;
and then he said , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t mean your fish : a farm that makes your success measure at success .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that has no <unk> , he got enormous , because the water that comes through this farm comes out of the river .
it &apos;s a river that brings all the things that rivers today tend to lead to them , chemical pollutants , from <unk> .
and as it comes through the system , and this leaves is the water clean , as it &apos;s <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it eats water .
so not just a farm that doesn &apos;t prevent their animals , not only a farm that affects their success in health , but a farm that literally is a <unk> , not just for those fish , but for you and me .
because when the water <unk> , it <unk> in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take it , and that &apos;s what you should do , because these conversations , as zipcar are always , is also <unk> .
you might say it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , one in food , in fact .
but for a lot of people , it &apos;s a little too radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we <unk> . we &apos;re wrong .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we talk about food food . we eat food .
and if you say that these are things that are the future of good food , someone goes somewhere and says , &quot; hey people , i love <unk> <unk> , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how will they feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we produce enough calories to feed the world more than just feed .
a billion people are born today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of the <unk> effects in the distribution , not the <unk> .
now , i don &apos;t like that question because she has the logic of our <unk> for the last 50 years .
if we feed more people cheaper , how terrible can it be ? &quot;
that was the kind of thing . it was the <unk> of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , which is a garden in <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> capital that allows that production .
this is not a solar system , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our <unk> today is independent , not because of <unk> , but due resources .
not through the latest <unk> and <unk> , but by <unk> land , not by pump , but by <unk> water , not by <unk> , but by forests , and not by <unk> and nets , but through fish and nets , but through fish .
they want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions to feed any community ?
to do that , don &apos;t look for the future for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines stand at it , and it never produced something really good for food .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is the one that <unk> for two billion years .
look at yourself , farmers like <unk> .
businesses that are not worlds for themselves , businesses , who tend to grow rather than <unk> , businesses , who are not only <unk> , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones who are also experts for taste .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better actor than i &apos;ll ever be .
you know , i &apos;m right , because if this is the future good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to tell you one of the things that we consume today is that the data of the data that we consume is greater than the sum of their parts and rather than thinking about thinking about how we can use information that we can use information to look at patterns , and we realize that otherwise would not be visible .
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical <unk> of age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and what i can do with <unk> is that , after a certain reason , i can go to a certain extent , say accidents .
and immediately i see another pattern that &apos;s going on .
it &apos;s because there are people on the top of the table here , and they &apos;re over here at the <unk> .
we can take a step further and push the data , and see that <unk> and cancer are the usual , but not for everyone .
now , if we go now and look at age age , we say 40 years or younger , we see that accidents even is the most common thing to worry about .
and who sees that this is especially true in men .
so what you see is that the looking of information and data in this way is in a <unk> view of swimming .
and if we can do this for data , why not do for content itself ?
so what we have here are the <unk> , every single one , &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
it &apos;s all over here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it for my talk in your hands .
with <unk> , you can go into a decade .
you can get into one particular year .
you can jump directly to a particular copy .
now , when i look at this , i see the mechanics that appear in this copy and the <unk> .
i &apos;m a classic armstrong fan , so what i &apos;m going to do is show me all the time i &apos;m talking about in particular armstrong .
now , if i want to just get a <unk> , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at it all with the subject ? &quot;
so i go back and look at the perspective .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea of that , if you look at this kind of information , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you don &apos;t search or <unk> .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little different .
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so i want to take this idea a little bit further with something like a little crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we took every single sample of production and put it on a small scale .
the m contains a short , and a symbol for the area coming out of .
i &apos;m just showing the top 500 of the <unk> .
but even in this <unk> view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a sense of the issues that are on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government .
now , after i &apos;ve chosen government , i &apos;ve come to know that the <unk> that most people are doing most about this year is &quot; people of the year . &quot;
this is really important because this is an insight that doesn &apos;t exist in a single <unk> .
that &apos;s just to recognize one step and look at the whole .
<unk> on one of these <unk> , i can then go into the theme of time , &quot; people of the year , &quot; and all together .
now , if i look at all of these people , the majority of them are <unk> , some of them come from science , some , less , from the economy . here &apos;s my boss . and one comes from <unk> .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
so now we can jump and look at all the ted prize winner .
you can see , we &apos;re looking at the web for the first time if it &apos;s really a web , not just to side , but a lot of invisible .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise might be .
let me just show you the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at it -- and we bring these <unk> to every single website like this .
so i can go back and jump directly to a specific <unk> .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s important because you &apos;re just looking at looking at websites in this way that you can look at the same way in the same way .
so i can go into my course in a certain time .
here &apos;s the state of the entire demonstration that i &apos;ve given up until this point .
and i can look at everything i &apos;ve been looking at today .
and , again , if i take a step back and look at it all , i can take my way back to my <unk> . here , i &apos;m looking for <unk> , or here to live villages .
and from here , i can go into the page and bring it back .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used again , and each time it makes the big bigger than the sum of the <unk> .
right now , in this world , we think data is a <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; vulnerability in information . &quot;
what if we could turn that situation and put the internet on the head , so that instead of always walking from one to another , many things can be able to do , and see patterns that otherwise hidden hidden ?
if we can do this , this is going to <unk> , maybe a new source of information information .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge from it .
and if we know , then maybe we can even pull away from it .
so i &apos;m listening , thank you very much .
i grew up with a <unk> of science fiction .
in my high school , i went to school every day an hour .
and my nose always put it in a book , a <unk> that <unk> my thoughts in other worlds , and in <unk> ways my deep , <unk> curiosity .
and this curiosity also showed me that if i wasn &apos;t in school , through the forests of the forests , went to the forests , went to &quot; samples , &quot; frogs , frogs , snakes and snakes and <unk> , everything home , and under the microscope .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was all about trying to understand the world and the limits of the potential .
and my love of science fiction seemed to be in my environment , because at that time , in the late &apos; 60s , we went to the moon and the deep sea .
jacques pinker came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows that animals and places and a world of wonder showed that we &apos;ve never imagined before .
now , that &apos;s probably what <unk> <unk> did .
and i was artists .
i could draw . i could paint .
and since there was no video video video video games , and there &apos;s still the whole <unk> of the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
we all had to . when we read kids as a book , we took the description of the <unk> and put it on the canvas in our heads .
my response to this was the drawing and painting of aliens , dangerous worlds , robots , <unk> and all kinds of things .
in <unk> , i was getting all the time from the teacher , as i was , <unk> <unk> .
creativity had to sort of get out of creativity .
and something interesting happened , which was interesting to me about jacques <unk> , the thought of a completely unknown world here on our earth .
i certainly would never reach a typical world , and it seemed quite unlikely to me .
but here was a world i could actually walk on earth , and it was also fascinating , and it was as fascinating as all of the things that i &apos;d been looking at when i read those books .
so i decided when i was 15 .
the only problem with this was that i lived in a small village in canada , a hundred miles from the nearest ocean .
but i didn &apos;t let .
i <unk> my father until he finally made a <unk> in new york , new york , <unk> , right on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a <unk> <unk> center in winter , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , got to face two years later when we moved to california .
since then , over 40 years , i spent about three thousand hours under water , 500 hours of it .
and i learned that the world of deep deep , even in the northern ocean , is so rich in <unk> life , as we can actually hardly imagine .
nature doesn &apos;t know boundaries , unlike our own , <unk> human imagination .
by the days of today , i &apos;m going to feel deep awe for what i see on my feet .
and my love of the ocean is holding , with the same intensity , ever .
when i came up with a profession as an adult , it was <unk> .
that seemed the best way to tell my inner , to tell stories , with my need to create images .
as a child , i <unk> constantly and so forth .
so movies were the way , images and stories , and that fit together .
of course , the stories i came from , of course , the <unk> : &quot; <unk> , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> , &quot; i was able to connect my checklist for the <unk> and the <unk> .
so basically my two passions .
something interesting happened in &quot; <unk> &quot; : to solve a problem in this movie -- and that &apos;s what we had to do as a kind of liquid <unk> -- we put it on <unk> animation , <unk> , back .
and what it came out was the first place to be ever seen in a movie .
the film didn &apos;t get any money , in fact , he used to play his <unk> , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience all over the world was like art from the magic , which was about it .
according to arthur c. &apos;s law is , you know , technology &apos;s law , and it &apos;s not different from each other .
so they saw something magical .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought to myself , &quot; wow , that needs to be put into <unk> . &quot;
so we went to &quot; collect 2 , &quot; my next film , far further .
along with <unk> , we created the guy out of liquid metal , and the success was entirely on how this effect would go .
and it worked . again , we had created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same . however , we &apos;ve had the film a little bit more money .
from these two experiences , a whole new world has reached , a whole new world of creativity for <unk> .
so i started a company , along with my good friend <unk> , who was the best <unk> and <unk> at the time , called digital <unk> .
the idea of this company was to <unk> the phase <unk> processes with visual <unk> and the same <unk> .
we then did that , and then we &apos;ll give us a <unk> .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that in <unk> and <unk> -- we actually started the company -- too slowly .
i had written this piece &quot; <unk> , &quot; which <unk> the <unk> in terms of visual effects and <unk> effects in a whole new way , with the same human , tragic characters that had been created by <unk> , and the <unk> should all be <unk> , and the world should be <unk> .
but the <unk> <unk> quite beautiful . and people in my company told me that we were not able to do this .
so i got this and made this other film about the big ship , the <unk> .
the <unk> , i have used this as &quot; vagina and dance on a ship . &quot; it became a <unk> <unk> , a happy movie .
but what i really wanted to do was to do the real <unk> of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i made the movie .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
but i convinced you , by saying , &quot; we &apos;re coming to the <unk> . we film the real roof .
we &apos;ll show it in the <unk> of the movie .
this is extremely important . it &apos;s a good <unk> for marketing . &quot;
and i decided to fund them .
sounds crazy . but this goes back to the fact that your imagination can create reality .
and then six months later , i actually created a reality where i was in a russian <unk> <unk> , four miles below the surface of the atlantic , and i &apos;m looking at the real titanic through a <unk> .
it wasn &apos;t a movie , no <unk> , it was real .
so , that really changed me .
and we had to build cameras , and we had to build cameras and <unk> and everything .
and i noticed how much this <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
you get up into that dark , you go into this dark , <unk> environment , where there &apos;s no hope for saving if you don &apos;t make it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s as if i was in a <unk> .
it &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was really obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
anyway , with curiosity and science , it was all . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience i couldn &apos;t give me .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could then design a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was going outside of the planet .
i &apos;ve seen creatures in <unk> , and sometimes things i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that had never seen before , and for the science at the time , when we saw them , there were no words .
so that really <unk> me , and i wanted to do more .
and so i met some unusual decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want my <unk> as a filmmaker in hollywood on ice , and i &apos;m going to <unk> for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we went to &quot; <unk> , &quot; and they brought them with <unk> .
we went back to the head of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which was a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was to <unk> and look at the inside of the painting that had never been done before .
no one had ever done the inner inside , and you didn &apos;t have resources for it . so we developed the technology .
well , i &apos;m sitting there , on the board of the titanic , in a <unk> , and looking at <unk> , which is pretty similar to these <unk> , and i know once the band played there .
and i fly with a little <unk> on the <unk> of the ship .
it &apos;s actually only because my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically <unk> within the titanic .
this was the most powerful form of a <unk> i ever experienced , because before i walk around a corner , i always knew what was going to be in the <unk> of the vehicle , because i was walking around the movie when we finished the film .
the set was an accurate copy of the design of the ship .
so that was a complete strange experience .
she made me realize this <unk> that you use such <unk> <unk> and your consciousness into the vehicle , in this other form of existence .
it was really amazing .
and maybe a little bit of a sense of what might happen in some decades , if you have <unk> to explore something or other things , in all sorts of different ways that i can imagine as a <unk> .
so after this survey , we began to learn what we were seeing at the bottom , for example , this <unk> where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . these are sort of <unk> , but here on earth .
they live with help from <unk> .
they don &apos;t exist in the sunlight in sunlight , like we do .
and so you see animals right next to 500 degrees centigrade , and you can survive there .
at the same time , i was also very interested in <unk> , which was back to my childhood .
and so i ended up talking to the people who are interested in space and having to do with nasa and to sit in the lab and do the right model . they go to russia , and they &apos;re going to russia , and they go to russia , and they go back to russia , they fly to international <unk> and take our <unk> .
that was fascinating .
but at the end of it , i ended up with the deep sea .
i took them , and i gave them access to the world down there : <unk> , <unk> , people who were interested in such extreme situations , and i took them to the sources so they could take care of samples , take samples and instruments and so on .
so , let &apos;s go through it , but actually , science , actually said science .
so the circle between my existence as <unk> , then as a child , and the <unk> into reality .
i learned a lot about this .
i learned a lot about science . but i &apos;m sure you &apos;re probably going to have to have a director , a leader like a <unk> or something .
i didn &apos;t understand much about leadership before i <unk> these .
because at some point , i had to say , &quot; what am i doing here ?
why do i do that ? what comes out ? &quot;
these <unk> films give us a money .
we &apos;re just playing the <unk> . there &apos;s no trace .
everybody thinks i &apos;d be between the titanic &quot; and &quot; <unk> , &quot; and it would have taken me out somewhere on a <unk> on the beach on the beach .
i have all these films , these enemies , for a very small audience .
no failure , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing it in the task of the challenge -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment that you have . you &apos;re doing it because of the <unk> , and because of the weird connection that happens when a small group of people form a team .
because we &apos;ve done all of this with only 10 to 12 people who &apos;ve been working for years , sometimes we were two to three months in sea .
and in that community , you realize the most important thing is that you have each other , because you have a task that you can &apos;t explain anything else .
when you go to the country and you say , &quot; we had to do it , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the whole way , the whole technology , and the trouble , the human <unk> , if you &apos;re working on lake , you can &apos;t explain the other simply . that &apos;s like police or soldiers who have gone together in common and know that you can never explain somebody .
there is a connection that creates respect .
so when i went back to turn my next film , &quot; click , &quot; i tried to use the same drug , which is that you have your team and you feel in your respect .
and so the dynamic really changed .
so that &apos;s where i was going back with a little team on <unk> terrain , and we were taking place with a new technique that had not been before .
extremely exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we &apos;ve been to a real family for four years .
and it changed my way to make films completely .
there were people who thought we &apos;d had these <unk> <unk> and <unk> on the planet .
for me , it was more like a <unk> way of doing my job , the real process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we do from all of this ?
what lessons have learned ?
i think the first place is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the <unk> of your team is more important than any <unk> of the world .
to me , a young filmmaker , they say , &quot; give me a advice of how i can do this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t worry yourself . &quot;
that &apos;s another one for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , don &apos;t bet against yourself . &quot;
nasa has such a <unk> : &quot; failure is not alternative . &quot;
but in art and studying , failure has to be an alternative because there &apos;s a <unk> .
no important thing to do , the innovation was ever given .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
that &apos;s the idea i &apos;d like to leave you with . failure is an alternative , fear is not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking about energy and climate .
and this may be a little bit , because my <unk> at the foundation was mainly about vaccines and <unk> to make the things we invent and provide the poorest two billion billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people , in fact , more important than any other on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> over many years don &apos;t grow , we too too little , or down too little . things will change the way that their <unk> environment cannot replicate .
that leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to intimacy .
so , it will be terrible for you .
it &apos;s also very important for them .
the fact is , if you could only reduce one thing at the price , it would be energy in weight .
well , <unk> is about time .
in fact , the <unk> on <unk> .
the <unk> industry , the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a <unk> case in <unk> , and that &apos;s why we &apos;ve been able to make modern materials and so many things do .
so we are in a wonderful situation of electricity in the rich world .
but if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s hit the price -- we hit a new barrier , and we depend on co2 .
co2 dioxide is actually quite clear to co2 .
it <unk> the <unk> co2 , which leads to <unk> , and this <unk> has some very negative consequences . effects on the weather , and perhaps worse , the consequence that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt such three-dimensional changes , and so we can &apos;t adapt whole systems .
now , the exact link between the <unk> and the <unk> and where the other consequences are , there &apos;s some <unk> , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly <unk> about how bad these consequences are , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
i asked the <unk> times , &quot; do we really have to go down to zero ?
does not have half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is : until we get close to zero , temperature will continue .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different to say , we have a <unk> foot truck that has to get under a <unk> bridge , and then you can sort of smell underneath it .
this has got to go down to zero .
well , we take a lot of <unk> every year , over 26 billion tons .
each americans is about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons on the planet .
and somehow we have to make changes that go to zero .
it &apos;s very limited .
there is only different economic changes in it at all , and we have to go from <unk> levels and to zero to zero .
this equation has four factors . it &apos;s a little bit <unk> . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that you want to get towards zero , and that &apos;s going to depend on the number of people , from the service , that every person on average uses , the average energy for every service and the co2 , which is <unk> .
so let &apos;s look at every factor and think about how we get this to zero .
probably one of these numbers must come very close to zero .
now this is basic shepherd , but let &apos;s go through it .
first , we have population .
today <unk> billion people live .
and it goes down to nine billion <unk> to move to nine billion .
if we succeed very successful with new drugs that are <unk> , we could probably reduce about 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time , we &apos;re looking at 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
that &apos;s all the food we eat , clothing , television .
these are very good things , and business means to almost anyone on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we could probably do <unk> and less use , but on average that number will increase every year , and so there are more than double , the number of services that are being killed per person .
here &apos;s a very fundamental service . there &apos;s light at home so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t , so they go out and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
well , efficiency , the e , the energy per service , finally have good news .
we have something that &apos;s not going up .
due to different changes in the <unk> , through new methods , through new ways of <unk> , there &apos;s a lot of services that can make some individual services by 90 percent .
in other ways , like making <unk> , <unk> <unk> : <unk> -- &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
in total , if we &apos;re optimistic , maybe maybe a factor of three or maybe even a factor .
but for the first three factors , we &apos;ve now gone from 26 billion to maybe <unk> 13 billion tons , and that &apos;s just not enough .
so let &apos;s take a look at the fourth factor -- and this will be a key thing -- this is the amount of co2 that &apos;s going to be <unk> per unit .
it turns out if you can get it to zero .
if you burn coal : no .
if you burn gas : no .
almost every cost of electricity today is co2 today , except renewables and <unk> .
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
now , if i use the term miracle , i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
it &apos;s a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and its services is a miracle .
people here have helped the development of many of these wonder .
normally , there &apos;s no doubt that you need a miracle to a certain date .
normally , you just get wrong and some come , others don &apos;t .
but in this case , we need to give <unk> and a miracle in a very short time .
now , i wondered how can i really get this ?
is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration that makes the idea of people here ?
i remembered that last year when i was wearing mosquitos , and somehow people liked this .
and the idea has been really <unk> for them , you know , that there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , this was one .
i decided it would be <unk> to the environment .
so here are some natural ingredients .
they told me they &apos;re not going to bite . they wouldn &apos;t even leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of <unk> like this , but they all get a lot .
we need solutions , either one or a number of which have a tremendous scale , and even though there are a lot of directions where people are looking for it , i really only see five who can afford these big choices .
i have trained , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
they might afford a <unk> , and if they afford better than i expect , that would be great , but my guess here is that we have to work on all those five , and we can &apos;t give them any of them because they all have problems .
if you look at the fossil fossil fuels , <unk> from either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do there , seems to be simple , but it &apos;s not . you &apos;ve got to do all the co2 that &apos;s coming out of the <unk> , you &apos;re going to get out of pressure , and then you go somewhere under pressure and you hope it stays there .
there are some <unk> that are based on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it &apos;s going to get 100 percent very difficult , and one of the <unk> for co2 is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is <unk> .
who will make it ?
who can guarantee something that literally many billion times larger than any kind of waste that you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of waste .
so this is a hard operation .
next : <unk> .
it also has three big problems . the cost , especially in <unk> countries are high , and the question for security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human being that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and what do you do with waste ?
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concern .
so three very difficult problems that might be specific , and that &apos;s why they should work .
the last three of the five i have .
it &apos;s the renewables that it &apos;s often called .
and again , even though it &apos;s great that you don &apos;t need fuel -- you &apos;ve got a few <unk> .
one is the <unk> that these technologies make dramatically dramatically than <unk> .
these are <unk> , you &apos;re talking about many <unk> , more than a normal power power .
furthermore , these sources of sources .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem all day , but it doesn &apos;t seem every day , too , too , too .
that &apos;s why , if you &apos;re dependent on these sources , the energy is also when it &apos;s not available .
so , there &apos;s great <unk> here . there are challenges in leadership . if we say for example , the energy energy outside the country is , they don &apos;t need just the technology , they have to deal with the risk that the energy from where it comes from .
and there &apos;s the <unk> .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve got all kinds of batteries that are made , like , for cars , computers , mobile phones , for everything . and this is what i &apos;ve done with the amount of electronic energy that the world uses , compared to it , and i found that all batteries that we produce now would be less than 10 minutes of <unk> .
so what we need here is a big breakthrough , something that will be 100 better than a factor of 100 times .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
this is what happens when you try to get these <unk> sources about say 20 percent -- 30 percent of the <unk> .
if you want to take care of 100 percent , you need an incredible <unk> .
now , where should we go , what is the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the goal ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on this . hundreds of them .
in each one of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
in many , they will say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think there are a lot of people in the ted group that are already involved there .
bill &apos;s has several companies , among other things , called the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invest in dozens of companies doing great things and interesting opportunities , and i try to support this .
nathan myhrvold and i fund a company , which , maybe surprisingly , the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the <unk> ; <unk> , <unk> .
development has stopped in that industry a while ago , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are there .
it means that instead of one part of the <unk> , one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the <unk> .
it &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
but , in fact , you &apos;ve had a long time , but you could never simulate whether it was going to work , but since we &apos;ve been able to compare it , you can simulate it , and you can see that , yes ! with the right <unk> , it looks like it &apos;s left .
and because you cut that 99 percent , much better .
in fact , you get the waste , and you can even use the waste of today as a <unk> .
instead of breaking the head , just burn it . a great thing .
the <unk> is used as a bit of a candle .
you can see , it &apos;s a kind of column , a lot of times called <unk> wave .
this is really the <unk> .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
that &apos;s the waste , the 99 percent . you &apos;ve got the part that &apos;s caught today , so it &apos;s called <unk> .
it &apos;s the u.s. u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you just <unk> <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
what should our agenda look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the final goal that we need to reach , and then we talk about <unk> .
many people speak about 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really very important that we get there .
the rest 20 percent are produced in the poor countries , and still a bit of agriculture , hopefully will be <unk> and <unk> to be clean .
so to reach that 80 percent , the developed economy must , including countries like china , their <unk> completely connected .
the other note says whether we use technology to use technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get it to the rest .
that &apos;s great important .
this is going to be a feature of this <unk> .
if we go back from there , what should we look back ?
it should contain the two elements .
we should use the energy energy to get more efficient , the less we eat , the less it will be , and therefore the temperature .
but in fact , this is a note for the things that we have companies that don &apos;t lead to the big <unk> , just the same , or even less important as the other , which is the speed of innovation for this explosion .
we have to measure these things with <unk> , and we can measure this : in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of great books to this subject .
the al gore book , &quot; we have the choice , &quot; and david <unk> &apos;s &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
they actually go through it and create a framework where this can be done wide , because we need support for all sides .
there &apos;s a lot to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very serious wish that we invent this technology .
if you give me one wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that , or i could choose that wish , which is , <unk> <unk> , without co2 , that wish will be .
this has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get that wish , the separation between the long and <unk> people are terrible , between the u.s. and china , between poor and rich , and almost all of these two billion will be much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
what kind of thing i do ?
we need to use more education .
if countries like <unk> meetings , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they were supposed to talk to these <unk> , and they would be convicted of the ridiculous low money that are spent for these innovative approaches .
we need <unk> , co2 , <unk> &amp; amp ; d is something that creates <unk> .
we have to spread the message .
we need to have dialogue and <unk> and do things that are going to be done by government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can meet it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . just to try to understand something better -- first of all , can you give us an idea of the scale of these investment ?
bill gates : in order to do the simulation on a supercomputer , all the big scientists get , what we &apos;ve done is we need a few 10 million , and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor , to make sure it &apos;s working , you &apos;re only in the <unk> million .
the difficult step is to find the building of the first <unk> , extra billion , and the place of actually building the first of it .
once the first one is finished , when he &apos;s walking , it &apos;s all clear , because the economy , the density is as different as we know it .
and to understand that right , that means deep into the soil , almost like a vertical column , nuclear nuclear <unk> , and then the process starts going up and goes forward ?
<unk> : right . now you &apos;ve got to get rid of the reactor , so there are lots of people and lots of control that can go wrong , and this thing where you open it up and things like <unk> or <unk> . that &apos;s not good !
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can <unk> it for 60 years -- think of a column -- you &apos;re going down without all the <unk> .
and it &apos;s sitting there for 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a <unk> , even a solution to the garbage .
<unk> : yeah . now , what happens to the waste : you can sit it in -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with that method -- then you take it and put it in the next reactor and burn it .
and what we &apos;re starting to do is we start to take the waste , which is already exists in these <unk> or <unk> . this is our <unk> .
so , this is what these reactors have been a problem , what we put in our bodies , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do with that , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to dramatically reduced as that process .
but as you talked to different people around the world .
where is the biggest interest , really ?
<unk> : well , we haven &apos;t got a place yet , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting <unk> to everything that we call &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name . there &apos;s a lot of interest , and the people of the company were in russia , india , china ... i was here , and i talked to the <unk> and talked about how this was going on .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something to the direction .
this is a version of one thing that was made .
that &apos;s an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor , and some countries have built this built , so everyone who has fast a fast reactor , a <unk> for our first .
in your imagination , how much and chance of calling it really into life ?
<unk> : now we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent , and then for 20 years .
that &apos;s sort of the <unk> that has given us the <unk> that we have to fix .
and , you know , <unk> , if everything works well , and that &apos;s a big wish , could make it easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of people who , in the same way , where they work , if their actions work , that will work for their patents .
and it would be best if it &apos;s multiple , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
according to the great potential , is this the biggest thing you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important thing .
it would have been without the <unk> , but the power is so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as this , but there are the <unk> method , which is a different approach .
there &apos;s a <unk> , which seems to be a little difficult , but maybe they say about us .
and so there are different things , but the nice thing about this is that a million times a million times as much energy as a , say , a <unk> , and therefore , if you can deal with the problems , and that &apos;s mostly the radiation , the footprint and the cost , the potential , the impact on the country and other things , almost in a way .
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
do we have to <unk> in order to keep the <unk> stable ?
<unk> : when you get to that situation , it &apos;s like you eat too much , and you &apos;re in front of a heart attack , so what do you do ? you need maybe a <unk> or something .
there &apos;s a <unk> called <unk> that uses different techniques to make warming , so that we can have 20 or 30 years longer .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you don &apos;t want to work in the <unk> , because maybe you &apos;re going to keep eating it , because you know that you &apos;re going to save a <unk> .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you look at the importance of this problem in front of your mind , but there &apos;s a <unk> in there about whether you should have this , if things get faster , or that innovation takes longer than we expect .
<unk> : do you have one or two sentences to convince you ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the <unk> are in very different camps .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
do you say there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds ?
there are very , very few things you can even say that there &apos;s a chance in one million .
this is kind of like aids .
you make the mistakes now , and you pay a lot later .
and so the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of <unk> problems to invest in something that you &apos;ve only talked about later -- and you get to get the investment not so clear . in fact , the higgs report is not necessarily the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world that look at it , and say , okay , that &apos;s not a big deal .
the fact is that these uncertainty should make us worry .
but my dream here is , if you can make it more efficient , and at the same time you add co2 , it &apos;s also saying , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not interested in it that it &apos;s not co2 , i wish it &apos;s going to do it , but i think i &apos;ll accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be the answer to the <unk> <unk> argument that , if you use all of this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals below suffering , the <unk> , the <unk> of malaria and so on , that there &apos;s a stupid waste of resources to spend money on , while there are better things we can do .
<unk> : well , the real spending of research -- say , the u.s. government should spend 10 billion a year more than they do today -- that &apos;s not that dramatic .
below other things shouldn &apos;t suffer .
you come to large <unk> , and here &apos;s ordinary people , if you have something that &apos;s not sustainable , and trying to fund that for me .
it &apos;s because , you know , it &apos;s very short in front of you a <unk> , and i think we should try to do more things that have the potential to be very expensive .
if the <unk> you get is a very high <unk> , then only the rich are <unk> .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing its lifestyle .
but for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> thinks .
his new <unk> is now , &quot; why is it not going to happen ? &quot;
he &apos;s still going to be , because of his former stories , with the <unk> , but he understood that this was a very lonely group , and that &apos;s why he &apos;s now taking the <unk> .
and this is a <unk> that i think is appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just crazy . it &apos;s just crazy .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking about almost all of the people here , when i say , i really hope you &apos;ll be true . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago here at ted , peter <unk> <unk> a <unk> called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . it &apos;s got to be the largest <unk> structure with 20 degrees , about three feet tape , about three and a <unk> .
it has to be on top .
and , although it &apos;s really simple , it &apos;s really hard , it &apos;s really hard to get people to work very quickly .
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i turned it into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve been around about 70 million around the world , with students , engineers and architects , even with the <unk> of the <unk> , and there &apos;s a little bit of that task , which is a deep way into nature , and i want to share some of it with you .
usually , most people tend to engage themselves on task .
you talk about it , think about what it looks like , it &apos;s going to look around .
then they invest a little bit of time in planning and organization , and they <unk> and put it out .
they spend a lot of their time in the <unk> constantly structures .
and finally , just before you don &apos;t have time , someone takes the seat , and you put it on top of the top , go back to the top , and take a step back and <unk> . &quot;
but then , almost always , what happens is this is called &quot; <unk> &quot; to a &quot; <unk> , &quot; because the weight of the <unk> makes the whole thing up and <unk> .
there &apos;s a number of people who have a lot more like &quot; <unk> &quot; than others , and among the worst ones are fresh <unk> .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused and they &apos;re really <unk> shapes .
and of course , there are teams who have much more &quot; <unk> , &quot; and among the best are fresh <unk> of the <unk> .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter told us , it &apos;s not just the highest towers , but the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be asking : how is that ? why ? what about those ?
and peter tells you , &quot; none of the kids spend more time in the boss of the <unk> . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest in <unk> .
there &apos;s another reason .
it &apos;s that <unk> were trained to find a right plan , ok !
and then you realize it .
so what happens when you put the wheels on the top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what &apos;s different is that they start using the computer and prototype prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the <unk> at the top , so that they were able to fix <unk> prototypes .
<unk> recognize this kind of collaboration as the core of a <unk> .
and with each trial the children immediately get feedback and what &apos;s not .
so the power of working with prototypes is far more important -- but let &apos;s see how different teams are doing .
the average for most is about <unk> , <unk> , half of them are doing a little bit more , but not much , <unk> are better than adults .
who &apos;s most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
three is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand triangles and <unk> patterns are key to build smart structures .
h are over average . but this is where it gets interesting .
you put a <unk> on your team , you &apos;re going to do better .
it &apos;s incredible . you see , this team is going to win . &quot;
you can predict that . why is that ?
because they have special skills of <unk> .
they drive the process ; they understand it .
and that team , the <unk> and the work will improve the performance of a team .
<unk> skills and <unk> and their combination lead to success .
if you &apos;ve got 10 teams that are typical , you get about six , the valuable structures .
now i was trying to do something .
i thought we &apos;re going to bring the <unk> .
so i offered a $ <unk> prize to the winner .
what do you think happened to these <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone had built a <unk> high bomb , he would get the price home .
so is it not interesting that high levels have a strong effect ?
we did this practice with the same students .
what do you think happened now ?
now , she understood the advantage of the peace .
this is the same , bad team of one under the best .
it &apos;s produced the highest construction in the time .
there are also <unk> lessons for us , about nature and success .
you might ask : why would someone actually invest time to create a <unk> ?
and the reason is i create digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games and <unk> <unk> .
and what the <unk> does is they help to identify hidden assumptions .
because frankly , every project has its own teeth .
the challenge offers shared experience , a common language to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience of this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested can visit <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see how to build <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
you find crazy examples of all around the world like people &apos;s system and <unk> .
there &apos;s also <unk> .
and the most exciting lesson , i think , is actually a <unk> sport .
it requires that we all focus our senses on the task , and that we use our thinking about how our feelings and what we do , the challenge we care about .
and sometimes a small prototype of this experience is all it takes us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- to a &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
do we as if we had a machine here .
a big machine , cool machine , and that &apos;s a time .
and everybody in this room has to come in .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here .
and i wonder what they would choose because i asked my friends at the last time , and they all wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to time before there was cars or twitter or america .
i don &apos;t know .
i believe that you &apos;re kind of towards <unk> , too <unk> .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a magician .
it &apos;s because possibilities don &apos;t go back on this planet , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
this is the greatest time that there was ever on this planet , no matter what scale they are : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , <unk> .
there was never a time like this .
my <unk> died when they were 60 .
my grandparents did this number to 70 .
my parents are the 80 of the <unk> .
so there was better one nine at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a larger thing than that .
a child today will expect to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox was killed billion people on this planet .
they &apos;ve created the density of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we have <unk> them . <unk> .
in the rich world , there are diseases that are still threatened millions of us only one generation , hardly yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
anybody know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , they are <unk> of scientific method .
and from my point of view , the scientific method is to try and try things out , see if it works , it changes if it &apos;s not true , one of the greatest aspects of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s all good news , because there are some other problems , and they &apos;re often mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our <unk> a billion people on this world every day .
that number goes up , and it goes very fast , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we used our imagination to <unk> this world .
drinking water , <unk> land , oil , oil , gas : they disappear , and that &apos;s soon , and if we don &apos;t get rid of this chaos , we &apos;re going to disappear .
so the question is : can we do that ? i guess .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the country that they live on .
i think we can power this world with energy that they don &apos;t .
i really believe this , and no , that &apos;s not a <unk> .
but this is holding me at night at night -- one of the things that kept me awake at night . we &apos;ve never got scientific progress yet .
and we &apos;ve never been able to <unk> it as we can .
we &apos;re on the threshold , amazing events in many areas , and yet i really think that we have to go back hundreds of years before we have to go back to find a time where we &apos;ve been fighting progress , where we have the progress of these things that we have , more than now .
people are <unk> in their faith , so that you can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth is going to free it .
and listen , everybody has a right to his opinion ; even a right to progress .
but you know what you &apos;re not right ?
they &apos;re not right to their own facts . &apos; <unk> , they don &apos;t .
and i needed a while to figure out that .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article on &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
and i was amazed at resistance , on resistance to what &apos;s most effective in health care in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i did just what i always do , and i wrote an article .
and soon , i wrote an article about <unk> changed .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were crazy .
so , i wrote an article about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this would be &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they believed that molecules in a particular way , a random kind of <unk> in the field of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i continued .
i mean , i &apos;m journalist .
we type , we rich , we eat , that &apos;s okay .
but the article was worried about me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i found it out .
and that &apos;s because these <unk> , which made me crazy , they weren &apos;t at all .
these were <unk> people , people , rich people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that brought me so much ...
but then i thought , you know what , we &apos;re honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as we used to .
we talk about it .
what we &apos;re talking about is , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , so there &apos;s reasons , and i think we know what reasons are .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why this should not be that .
you can just call some names and people will understand .
<unk> , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , mass mass , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people we thought they were always right , so be skeptical .
ask them , ask evidence , demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything for granted .
but here &apos;s the thing : if you get evidence , you have to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
and i can do that from the reason that we now live in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen before , and i &apos;ll never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story published a story , a terrible story , which was the <unk> and <unk> vaccine .
very uncomfortable .
and many studies have been done to see if that was true .
<unk> studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious thing .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , at all .
it doesn &apos;t make a difference . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe in dan , we think what we see , what we think we see , what we think we &apos;re really feeling .
we don &apos;t believe in a set of documents from a <unk> that gives us data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of that was <unk> .
more importantly because of this fact , the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the <unk> are <unk> .
this is <unk> , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happens is we could do that .
well , i understand that . that &apos;s what i do .
because anybody here ?
has a single one in the audience who die of dying ?
doesn &apos;t happen very often .
in this country , not at all , but in fact , in the world last year .
that &apos;s a lot of deaths , 20 per hour .
but because that &apos;s not what happened here , we can do it , and people like <unk> can go back and read messages from fear and <unk> of platforms like <unk> and larry king live .
and they can do that because they don &apos;t connect the cause and they don &apos;t connect .
you don &apos;t understand these things seem to be the same , but almost never the same .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> us from one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , disappeared .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
it &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he &apos;s developed a <unk> with other people .
it can save the lives of <unk> , 150,000 children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , right ?
now , that &apos;s good , besides paul <unk> and about vaccines and says how valuable they are , and that people would just stop asking .
and that &apos;s what he says .
so paul is a <unk> .
when paul talks talks about a public speech , he can &apos;t tell the <unk> .
he gets calls at home because people like him to know where his children go to school .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are <unk> .
if you take it away , the diseases come back , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s what happens .
we &apos;re in this country now .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon children will die of it , because that &apos;s just one question for numbers .
and they &apos;re not just dying of dying .
what about <unk> ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
a group of mine wrote me a couple of weeks ago , and i said , i &apos;m a little too <unk> .
no one ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t miss her child against <unk> . no case .
ok .
why ? because we don &apos;t have <unk> . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have <unk> in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe this morning &apos;s in lagos this morning , and you &apos;re flying to los angeles , right now , he &apos;s over canada .
and in a few hours , he goes and <unk> a car , and he &apos;s going to come to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of those <unk> <unk> tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know it , because that &apos;s how the world works .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do it as if it &apos;s not .
we love to <unk> ourselves . we love that .
have you all taken this morning tonight ?
<unk> , a little <unk> that helps you in your own mind .
i know they did that because half of americans do that every day .
they take this stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find that they &apos;re useless .
the data gives it all the time .
they do their <unk> . they almost never do .
that &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark bucks .
i agree with you .
dark darkness . dark .
why are we doing that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we should not . our healthcare system is <unk> .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and <unk> ourselves that can afford .
so we run away before , and where are we going ?
we walk into the arms of <unk> .
that &apos;s great . i love <unk> .
but , you know , it &apos;s really serious , because the stuff is stupid , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
and i have all kinds of little particles here .
none of them -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , because i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we spend billions of dollars on it , it &apos;s inevitable .
and you know what ? when i say that , people say , &quot; what do you care ? let me do people what you want .
that &apos;s how you feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter to me if it &apos;s the audience who says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to not accept the evidence of my experts , &quot; or some <unk> who wants to treat his patients with <unk> .
if you look at this path where belief and magic and science replace you can get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he brought 400,000 people of his people , because he was convinced that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are much more effective than psychological drugs that we know that they can do the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths in a country which is worse than any other one of these disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have . they always have .
now , the <unk> epidemic that we &apos;re in right now is this creative struggle between the <unk> <unk> food and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . it needs to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphor .
this is ideology , not science .
all we eat , every <unk> , every branch , any branch , has changed by the people .
you know , there was no <unk> in paradise .
there was no <unk> .
there was no <unk> . we did it all .
we &apos;ve done it over the last several years .
and some of it worked and doesn &apos;t work .
we &apos;ve turned out what doesn &apos;t work .
now we can do it more closely . and of course there &apos;s risks , but we can do something like vitamin a &apos;s in rice , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand .
we changed food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i hear is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want modern lives .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
and you know what my answer to all of this is ?
yeah , you &apos;re right . fix that .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , but that &apos;s not science .
it has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
you know , science is not a company .
it &apos;s not land .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we fear is a real woman , and it keeps millions of people off the circle .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;ll have 70 percent more food than it is at the moment . 70 percent .
these investment in africa in the last 30 years .
<unk> . thank you .
you need that , and we don &apos;t give them it .
and why ? <unk> changed the food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff like this .
it &apos;s a thing that half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s kind of like a text .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s <unk> .
it has no nutrients , it has no protein , and scientists are building all of this at all .
and then people could eat the food and wouldn &apos;t be blind .
you wouldn &apos;t win , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and all i can say is , why do we fight this ?
i mean , we ask ourselves , why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want genes .
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our passionate passion for hormones , our <unk> for greater food , better food , food food .
it &apos;s not about rice <unk> , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we keep doing it as far as far as we do so far , we are interested in something that we don &apos;t want to be guilty of .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s our <unk> system , and we really have to stop it .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; are you still going to go into this strange time and go into the future ? &quot;
anyway . i want to do that .
right now , they &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put these on everything we want .
we can <unk> them where we want to <unk> them , and we &apos;re going to move them to where we want .
we need to have these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go into that time and go into the future , we &apos;ll be happy to have that .
i know we can , and as far as i &apos;m wrong , that &apos;s something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
i &apos;ve been interested in the <unk> for a while , and it may seem strange that a magician was interested in it , unless they look at it like me , as a deception , which is going to be a little bit , if somebody just believes there enough . &quot;
in other words , <unk> have shown a <unk> effect in a number of studies , the <unk> , and that &apos;s because the person thinks what to do with it , whether or some kind of -- in the <unk> , for example , there is , if the patient is only there enough to believe , a <unk> effect in the body called the <unk> .
a deception becomes a little bit of a illusion , because somebody like that .
and so we also want to understand each other , and now i want to show you a very simple approach .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that has been at least since the 1950s in each room for children .
i &apos;ve learned him from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to take it for you and explain him .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife that you can study ; my hand you can study .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife like this .
i turn my back back .
and to make sure that nothing in my mind disappears or from him , i &apos;ll just <unk> my wrist right here .
in this way , you can see that there &apos;s no time moving anything . as long as i &apos;m standing here , nothing can go into my apartment or come out .
and the goal is quite simple .
i &apos;m going to open up my hand , and hopefully , when everything goes well , the knife is going to go through my breath of light .
it &apos;s in fact , in his place , that i can shake it without the knife <unk> .
nothing goes into my <unk> or comes out , not <unk> , and you can study everything .
<unk> !
now , this is a trick that i often call a little kids who &apos;s interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception when you look closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably many of you know here in the room .
he works like this .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i &apos;m saying that i &apos;m going to <unk> my wrist to make sure that there &apos;s nothing in my breath or there , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i <unk> my wrist is that this is the secret of illusion .
at that moment , where i take my hand away from you , so you can see them moving from the back , so this finger here , my penguin , just from where he was , into a position where he &apos;s so <unk> .
great trick ?
there &apos;s somebody in the back there someone who had no childhood .
so , it &apos;s here . right ?
and when i look around , the fingers changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that you can only see three fingers down here : because the mind and the way it &apos;s information , it doesn &apos;t matter , one , two , three , but you as a group .
but that &apos;s actually not what it &apos;s about , and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s <unk> there , but it &apos;s not through the flow of my body , but through a trick , through my liver , which is now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing is going to happen by looking at it , through this movement , that the fingers will <unk> .
i take this hand away . and here is the knife .
you can introduce this trick to your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with <unk> ?
a year ago , i read a study that really <unk> me .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing to me .
and here &apos;s what it turns out : if you offer a <unk> in the form of a white pill , in the shape of a <unk> , that &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a certain level effect .
but if you look at the shape in which you give them a smaller pill , for example , into a smaller pill , and that blue color and a letter to it , it &apos;s actually more effective .
and that , although none of it is -- it &apos;s just <unk> .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really <unk> me .
but it turns out that &apos;s not all .
if you take <unk> , it &apos;s more effective than any shape .
it &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s yellow at a end , and the other red is better than a white bar .
it also plays a role .
a pill twice is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact exact statistics . sorry .
but the key thing is , ...
and that &apos;s also a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you have to move to the needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> of a <unk> substance that gives you a patient .
it creates a very strong picture in your head . it &apos;s much stronger than a white pill .
this graph is really -- i &apos;m going to show you a different time when we have an airplane .
so the fact is that the white pill are not as good as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a bomb that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
and none of them really have tremendous property . it &apos;s only our belief that we have in a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a device .
i take something that obviously is a deception , and it looks real .
we know from this study that you have to go to the needle if you want to go .
this is a 18 inches long . she &apos;s very , very <unk> , and i &apos;m going to give you a little bit of it first .
this is really my flesh . it &apos;s not <unk> <unk> meat .
this is my skin . this is not a novel from hollywood .
i &apos;m going to break that needle into my skin , and through them , up to the other side .
if you &apos;re going to hear it , if you fall in touch -- i made a couple of friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and i &apos;ve become a woman nearly .
so i &apos;m going to propose if you &apos;re going to shake fast , you &apos;ll look away for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first <unk> part over here .
you can see it in the same way , but if you like .
so , right here where my flesh starts , at the bottom part of my hand , i &apos;m just going to make a little <unk> .
i &apos;m really sorry . is it crazy ?
and just a little bit through my skin and on the other side , again .
so now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had when we had <unk> .
about that .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;ll show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when you see this .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not as stupid and <unk> himself the skin to talk for a few minutes . &quot;
well , i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people go back , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see it right . &quot;
the people in the <unk> come in now .
let me show you from close .
this is really my skin . this is not a novel from hollywood .
that &apos;s my flesh , and i can <unk> it .
sorry . if you &apos;re angry , look away , don &apos;t look .
you know , the people in the back or the ones who once see that later on video are going to say , &quot; well , this looks pretty cute , but if it were real , it would -- you see , here &apos;s a hole , and there , if it was really real , it would hurt . &quot;
okay , let me give you a little blood for you .
yes , here it is .
i usually would take the needle now .
i would open my arm and show you that there are no chairs .
but i think in this framework here , and with purpose , i think , of deception , make something real , i &apos;m just going to leave the needle up there and go off the stage .
we &apos;re going to meet a couple of times in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;ll enjoy that . thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness today .
i &apos;ve taken some people the number of books that have been published with &quot; happiness &quot; in the last five years , and they gave them about 40 to 40 , and there were many more .
there &apos;s an enormous wave of happiness among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
everyone would like to make people happier .
but despite all this tide of work , there are multiple cognitive particles that make it almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly by these cognitive fall .
it &apos;s true of <unk> that think about your own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as close as everyone else .
the first of these fall is a <unk> , complexity .
it turns out the word happiness is simply not a useful word anymore , because we apply it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could do it , but in large and large , it &apos;s something we need to give up , and we &apos;ll assume the complicated view of what is well-being .
the second case is an illusion of experience and memory : that &apos;s basically what you &apos;re happy to be in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that &apos;s the obvious fact that we can &apos;t think of a thought that affects well-being without its meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive event .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a <unk> to one of my lectures , who was a story .
and then he added , really quite emotional , which has all the experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it did was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of <unk> music .
she didn &apos;t stop because he was <unk> with a memory ; the memory was warm , and the memory was all he had .
what this really tells us is that we could think about other people in the sense of the self .
there is a <unk> self that lives in the present and the present , capable of experience the past , but essentially only has the present .
it &apos;s the <unk> self , which is the doctor &apos;s doctor -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; does it hurt now ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s an <unk> self , and the self self is the one that comes back and the story of our lives , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor does explain by asking the question : &quot; how did you feel so recently ? &quot;
or , &quot; what was your journey to <unk> ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and both of them are part of the <unk> of happiness .
now , the <unk> self is a storyteller .
and this really starts with a fundamental reaction on our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories about telling stories .
our memory tells stories , which means that what we &apos;re all allowed to keep up with is a story .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients who are taking care of surgery .
i won &apos;t go into detail . she &apos;s not painful today , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are your records .
and you &apos;re asked , &quot; who from two ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b clearly has more protection . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how did these patients come from ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient has a much stronger amount of time on the <unk> than patient b .
the stories of <unk> were different , and because a very important part of the story is how they end up .
and none of these stories are very <unk> or great -- but one of them is that clear ...
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
and the worse one was where the pain was at the end of his peak . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after their <unk> , and much later , &quot; what bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a than b in <unk> .
now , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> self .
from the point of view , b himself had a longer time .
now , what you could do with a patient , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it works , and it works , you know , you could actually use the <unk> of patient a device by simply <unk> the tube .
that will lead the patient &apos;s patient , but a little bit less than before .
and if you do that for a few minutes , you can make sure that the self is worse from patient a little bit , and you have to make sure that the <unk> self is much better off , because now you have a better story about your experience .
what does a story look like ?
and that &apos;s true of the stories that gives us that , and it &apos;s true of the stories that we invent .
it turns out that there &apos;s a story of <unk> , significant and end .
end are very , very important , and in this case , <unk> .
now , the <unk> self lives his life .
it has half the <unk> , one after the other .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean most of the moments of our life -- and i &apos;ve got this -- you know , psychological present is true for about three seconds , which means , you know , there &apos;s about 600 million of them in a month . in a month , there are about 96 , most of them don &apos;t leave .
most of you are completely ignored by the <unk> self .
and yet , you kind of get the sense that you should count that what is happening during this particular period of life .
it &apos;s the existing resource we consume while we &apos;re in the world .
and how we use them to be very important , but that &apos;s not the story that <unk> itself for us .
so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is over time .
from the point of view itself , if you have a vacation and the second week is exactly as good as the first one , it &apos;s twice twice as good as the <unk> .
this doesn &apos;t work at all for itself .
for itself , the <unk> itself is hardly better than the <unk> <unk> because there are no new memories .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time is the critical variable that a <unk> self is different from a <unk> self , and a very little impact on that story .
now , the <unk> self does more than to remember and tell stories .
it &apos;s actually one of the things that matters , because if you have a patient who , if you have a patient who &apos;s going to have two two different surgeons and decide to decide what to vote , then the driver who has the memory , is the less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be chosen .
the <unk> self has no voice in that choice .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between choice . we choose between memories of experiences .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t normally think about our future as experiences .
we think about our future as <unk> memories .
and basically you can look at this , you know , as a <unk> of the self self , and you can think of yourself as one , which is kind of the <unk> self of experience that the <unk> itself needs .
i have the impression that if we do that , that &apos;s very often the case , that means that we &apos;re doing <unk> in the service of <unk> itself .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we get from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that &apos;s been given for itself .
and when i think about that , i think , of course , that we made in antarctica a few years ago , which clearly was the best time i had ever had , and i think quite often in terms of how often i think about other things .
and i probably journey from my memories of this <unk> journey , i would say about 25 minutes for the last four years .
now , if i ever had the first slide with the 600 pictures in that i would have spent another hour .
well , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s like a half and a half hours .
there seems to be a crowd .
now , i like a little bit extremely , you know , how little i &apos;m looking at at the level of memories , but even if you do more of it , there &apos;s a real question . why do we give memories so much weight in the weight of the weight that we give .
so i want you to think about a thought .
imagine your next speaker , you know , at the end of the day , all your images will be eaten , and you get a <unk> drug , so you don &apos;t remember anything .
now would you choose the same thing ?
and if you choose another meal , there &apos;s a conflict between your two types of self and you have to think about how you decide that conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think about time , you get an answer . and if you think of memories , you might get a different answer .
why we choose the <unk> that we choose is a problem that gives us a choice between the two types of self .
now , the two species of self are looking at two terms from happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the <unk> self ?
and then you &apos;d ask : how happy are the moments in life &apos;s life self ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for each other is quite complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re now making a pretty good notion of happiness itself over time .
if you &apos;re lucky enough to ask yourself , it &apos;s a very different thing .
it &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or wonder the person is when they think about their lives .
very different term .
anyone who doesn &apos;t understand these terms will be the exploration of happiness , and i &apos;m going to talk to a lot of researchers about well-being , which is the exploration of happiness for a long time .
the distinction between happiness itself and happiness has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two <unk> .
the current organization has a worldwide survey where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and about their experiences , and there was other efforts in the direction .
so over the last few years , we started learning about happiness of the two species of self .
and the main lesson that we , i think , is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone is with his life , and that teaches them not much about how happy he lives and vice his life .
just to give you a sense of correlation , the correlation is about <unk> .
what that means is , if you meet somebody , and you would say , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know about his size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that somebody &apos;s life as eight on a scale of 10 , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his <unk> self .
so the correlation is low .
we know what the happiness of happiness is .
we know money is very important , goals are very important .
we know happiness is primarily to be happy with people we like to spend time with people we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s unexpected .
so if you want to <unk> happiness of the two species of self , you will end up doing very different things .
the conclusion from what i said here is we really don &apos;t think we should think of happiness as a cure for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , briefly , another reason we can &apos;t really think about happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things when we think about life , and if we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california , they won &apos;t get the answer .
if you ask that question , you think that the people in california must be happier if they , say , in china .
and what happens is that when you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , let &apos;s say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate isn &apos;t very important for the <unk> self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the <unk> self that decides how happy people are .
now , because the <unk> self is responsible , at the end -- some people could end up going to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to follow what happens to people who are hoping to be happier .
now , your <unk> self will not be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think you &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , remember how terrible the weather was in ohio , and they feel that they made the right decision .
it &apos;s very hard to think about well-being , and i hope i have a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we started doing a couple of weeks ago , they told me that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came out of this swiss survey .
is this something you can bring to us , because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting result that we found in the conventional survey is a number we absolutely didn &apos;t expect .
we found that in terms of happiness itself .
when we look at how emotion is growing .
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large set of americans , about 96 , but it &apos;s a great depression , under income dollars a year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they &apos;ll become increasingly less likely to be active .
we get an absolutely flat line .
i mean , i &apos;ve seen rare lines .
what happens is obvious that money is not a <unk> but that lack of money is certainly suffering , and we can measure this very , very clear .
in the sense of the other self , the self self , you get a different story .
the more money you make longer is you .
it &apos;s not for emotions .
danny , throughout america , is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people take this seriously seriously , i mean , it seems to put everything on your head , everything that we believe , for example , in terms of <unk> and so on .
is there a chance that politicians that the country generally would take a place like serious and based on it based on it ?
<unk> : you know , i think there &apos;s recognition for the role of <unk> in politics .
the recognition will slowly be slowly in the united states , not a question , but in the united kingdom , it &apos;s happening right now and in other countries .
people are starting to think about happiness when they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will discuss whether they want to study or whether they want to study <unk> , so we have to be pretty soon .
how to increase happiness is very different depending on how you think and whether you think about the <unk> self or whether you think of yourself as well .
that &apos;s going to influence politics , i think , in the years .
in the united states , you <unk> to measure the population of population .
that will , i think , will be part of national statistics in the next decade .
well , it seems to me that at least the most important debate will be about the next few years .
thank you for the invention of economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m jane ; i &apos;m building video games .
i &apos;ve been doing <unk> now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in reality as it is in <unk> .
i have a plan for it . i want to convince more people , including all of you , spend more time playing playing games .
currently we spend three billion hours a week with <unk> .
some of you might think , &quot; that &apos;s a whole lot of time games . &quot;
maybe too much time when you think of how many problems we have to deal with the real world .
in fact , my research at the institute of the future for the future is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the highest problems in the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that time .
i mean , it &apos;s a time for 21 billion hours a week .
this may be something that happens first , so i put it in order to work : if we solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think we need to try and play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture describes quite accurate why i believe games are so essential to survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of photographers <unk> .
he wanted to play the feelings playing , so he built a camera in front of the players .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe some of them are in this picture .
you &apos;re probably going to see this sense of genius , a little bit of fear , but also to focus on a real difficult problem , a really difficult problem .
you also see , if you play , you can see some of them here looking up , and the mouth are a sign of optimism . the show show surprise .
this is a player who &apos;s on the edge of a so-called <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know it . ok . so we &apos;ve got some players here .
a <unk> victory is a result that is so profound positive that they didn &apos;t know it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond imagination .
and if you do it , you &apos;re shocked that you actually are capable of doing this . this is a <unk> victory .
this player represents a <unk> victory .
and this is what we have to see on millions of faces all over the world if we take the <unk> of the next century , the face of everybody who &apos;s standing on the edge of a <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we see more of this face in real life when we face hard problems .
i call it &quot; in life i &apos;m bad , &quot; and it &apos;s actually my face , see ? yeah ? ok .
that &apos;s me , like i &apos;m doing &quot; in life i &apos;m bad .
this is a <unk> in my former home in berkeley , california , where i was studying why we &apos;re better in games than in real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not as good at play in reality .
and i don &apos;t mean less successful , even though that belongs .
we reach more . i mean , in relation to motivation , with motivation , inspired with each other .
if we &apos;re in a <unk> , i believe that many of us will turn into our best version , at any time , immediately , to solve the problem as long as we needed it after the <unk> again .
and in reality , when we fail when we hit obstacles , we often feel differently .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel <unk> . we feel <unk> , maybe depressed or <unk> .
we never have these feelings when we play games , they just don &apos;t .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a photographer .
why is it impossible to think , you couldn &apos;t just do anything ?
how can we transmit these feelings from games into reality ?
so i looked at games like the world of museums , which is the ideal environment for collaborative public .
and i &apos;ve noticed a couple of things that are going to do so much in <unk> .
so first of all , if you go to one of these <unk> , especially in the world of russia , there are a lot of different characters that are ready to give you a <unk> mission , and immediately .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly to your current level in the game right ?
so they can .
they never get a task they can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of your skills , so you have to eat . but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of russia .
you don &apos;t sit around and <unk> . you have always to do something important .
and there are thousands of employees .
where they also go , hundreds of thousands of people who work together to stop their latest mission .
now , we don &apos;t have that easy life in real life , this feeling that if you &apos;re ready for a <unk> , <unk> staff .
and also , there &apos;s this great story , this inspiring story of why we are and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
you &apos;ve heard of &quot; level high &quot; and &quot; + 1 strength &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
this constant feedback doesn &apos;t exist in real life .
if i leave this stage , i wasn &apos;t going to talk about one and + one crazy idea , 3,000 20 crazy idea .
i get this feedback in real life .
so , the problem of <unk> , like the world of russia , is that it &apos;s so unlikely to stand at any edge on the edge of a day , that we &apos;d rather spend our whole time in these <unk> .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
up to today , all the world &apos;s world companies have spent <unk> million years studying virtual problems to solve problems .
that &apos;s not necessarily bad .
it sounds evil .
but to see it in context , millions of years ago , our first <unk> trip started .
so the first place is <unk> .
ok , so when we talk about how much time we spend with play , that only makes sense when you hold time in terms of the scale of human development , which is extraordinary .
but also , because it turns out , as we use all this time to play , we actually change what we are as human beings .
we &apos;re developing the way we &apos;re developing , including creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . this is what i believe .
and look at this interesting statistics , which recently published by a researcher called carnegie university , which is the average young person of today in a country with dense <unk> 10,000 hours to the 21st age .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states , <unk> hours of the exact <unk> they spend in school from the fifth grade to the end of high school -- if you never don &apos;t .
so here &apos;s a full <unk> that young people have as learning about what it means to be a good player , like anything else that you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have been the new book by malcolm journal , &quot; <unk> , &quot; read .
so she knows his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of <unk> that if we spend 10,000 hours with the <unk> study of a single subject to the 21st age , we &apos;re going to get involved in there .
we &apos;re going to do so well , whatever is the most important people in the world .
so what we have here is a full generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , &quot; what are players <unk> good ? &quot;
because if we could find that if we could figure that out , we would never have potential human potential before .
so many people in the world currently have spent an hour per day at least .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people who are extraordinary good in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are extraordinarily good at whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the <unk> developed <unk> that save energy and work on <unk> , rather than to make people around the world , especially in india , china , brazil , online .
you expect one extra billion players in the next decade .
so we &apos;ve got 1.5 billion players .
so i started to think about what it is for us to do these games .
here are the four things i found . first of all , <unk> .
ok , think about it as extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to immediately do something , to try and believe that we have a shared hope for success .
players always believe that a <unk> victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying to do that .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters in the british poet social nets .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show us that we like people more , after we played with them , even if they were comfortable with us .
the reason for this is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone .
we trust that somebody has given us the rules that we have the same goal and then remain there .
so that allows you to grow confidence , trust and each other .
as a result , we build more social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours of a week , rather than <unk> .
the reason is that , when we play , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard than when we fail or nothing .
we know that as human beings work , if we do hard work .
and players are always willing to work hard when they get the right task .
and ultimately , independent meaning .
players love to become part of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
here &apos;s a <unk> to back the right light into the right . you &apos;re familiar with all wikipedia , the largest <unk> in the world .
the second <unk> in the world , with almost <unk> <unk> , is the world of russia .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about the world of museums on the internet than any other subject in the world .
they create a great story .
they create a brilliant source of knowledge about the world of museums .
ok , so these are four actors that lead to a single outcome : players are <unk> , <unk> individuals .
it &apos;s people who think that they can change as a single world .
and the only problem is they think they can change virtual worlds , but not real .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is great . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to be less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and that &apos;s from an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like me ... i &apos;m a little <unk> .
so he says that makes sense , because players can reach more than in real life than in real life .
you can create social social games than in real life . you get more feedback and rewards in games than in real life .
so he says it &apos;s completely clear that players spend more time in the virtual world than in real time .
first of all , it &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not <unk> .
we need to start changing the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that <unk> <unk> years .
there &apos;s this <unk> cube , from <unk> . you know ?
before these amazing <unk> , there were <unk> .
and these were kind of the first of people developed <unk> .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the <unk> , you may know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
loud <unk> were playing games , specifically <unk> , in the kingdom of <unk> during a famine .
anyway , there was such great famine that the king of <unk> turned into a crazy idea .
people were suffering . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> , a national strategy , on a day . the next day you would play .
and they would be so fascinating into the <unk> , because games are so fascinating and with <unk> , <unk> productivity , that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat .
and according to <unk> , she <unk> the famine for 18 years by working on a day and the next played .
in the same way , i think we &apos;re playing games today .
we &apos;re playing games to get the suffering of the real world .
we &apos;re going to play games to identify everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , everything that doesn &apos;t work in real life , and we &apos;ll get what we need from play .
but that &apos;s not the end .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
according to 18 years , the famine did not better . so the king , one last <unk> <unk> .
they shared the kingdom in two .
they played a <unk> , and the <unk> was needed to a <unk> adventure .
they went <unk> , and they were looking for a new home , and they just had so many people back , as food gave food to survive , and went to the rest of a area where they were working .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but recent <unk> show that the <unk> , which later used to be the dominant kingdom , the same dna as the old <unk> .
and so scientists recently came to know that <unk> &apos;s crazy story is true .
and finally found evidence of a global economy that took almost 20 years to explain what the famine might explain .
so this crazy story could vote .
maybe you actually saved her people by play by 18 years in games , and then they had these <unk> , and they learned so much about each other , that they have saved the entire civilization .
so we can do that .
we &apos;ve been playing in 1994 .
this was the first <unk> in real time in the world of <unk> . this was 16 years ago .
they played for 18 years , for 16 years .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent half their civilization to find a new world , so i &apos;ll take my 21 billion <unk> a week .
we should argue that half of us spend an hour per day of play until we solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve the real world in play ? &quot; and this question , i &apos;ve got my work in the last few years at the institute of the future .
we have this <unk> in our office in our office to understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want to do is create the future .
we want to think of the best result , and then people are willing to take this idea into reality .
we &apos;re going to ask ourselves and give people the possibilities to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you just three games that i &apos;ve designed to try and create people &apos;s imagination in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> where you have to overcome a <unk> .
the <unk> is invented , but we have enough <unk> so that it will be realistic for you , and you actually ask your life without oil . so , if you go to play , tell us where you live , where you live , and then you get <unk> in real time that you show them how much oil costs , and we ask them to write about it , videos or photographs .
we tested this game with 700 players in 2007 since the last three years .
and i can tell you it was an art experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a <unk> adventure and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to go out of oil . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure .
find out how you would survive , most of our players have <unk> the game in the game .
so next time we have a bigger game for the next <unk> game than just <unk> .
we developed the game &quot; <unk> &quot; at the institute of the future .
it &apos;s the computation of a <unk> that people have left only 23 years on the planet .
this is called global <unk> , of course .
the call on players , <unk> , we have almost like a &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> .
you know jerry <unk> where it &apos;s the &quot; <unk> , &quot; you have the astronauts , the scientists , the <unk> and only together you can save the world .
but in our play , instead of just five people , say , everyone is in the <unk> , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game eight weeks long .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read when they &apos;re <unk> .
and the last game we put out on the third march , which is a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get from the world bank called social <unk> , 2010 2010 .
we work with universities all over africa , and invite them to learn social learning .
we have a <unk> . we have &quot; level high &quot; for <unk> , <unk> , sustainability , vision and imagination .
i &apos;d like to invite you all to share this game with young people all over the world , especially in <unk> , who benefit from themselves to social leaders to save the world .
so i come to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these amazing players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we &apos;ve got all this <unk> productivity , <unk> productivity , the ability to take close social nets , <unk> and desire for <unk> meaning .
i really hope that we play together big games to survive another century on this planet .
and i hope you &apos;ll design play like this and play .
when i go back to the next decade , i &apos;m sure two things : that we can create any <unk> future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the <unk> games !
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about what happened to me a few months ago when i was writing an article for <unk> magazine .
i kept writing my <unk> <unk> , but i was finished with the research of the <unk> , and i noticed that i had never given my life in my life , which means the word &quot; <unk> &quot; really means .
i &apos;ll read you the one .
<unk> : <unk> , helpless , <unk> , destroyed , destroyed , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , paralyzed , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , out of traffic , <unk> , <unk> , broken <unk> , <unk> , and weak and weak .
<unk> : healthy , strong , <unk> . &quot;
i came up with this list of friend loud , and i had to laugh , it was so ridiculous , but i only came to &quot; <unk> &quot; and i couldn &apos;t <unk> , and i had to go back to reading , and i &apos;m going to go through these <unk> <unk> and <unk> emotional shock .
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> . i just thought that it must be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early &apos; 80s , when i started high school , and that began to build my vision outside of my life , also in terms of other children and the rest of the world around me .
and i &apos;m not using god at that time .
if i was serious to use this as seriously , i would be born into a world that someone like me could perceive as a person whose life is positive , but i &apos;m going to be interested in the opportunities and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
so immediately , i asked myself the <unk> of 2009 , and i expected i find a <unk> contribution here .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
in particular , i &apos;ve looked at the last two words under &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people that we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
a lot of <unk> societies , including the greeks and the <unk> , have really believed that the recession has a huge force to have a big force , because what you can do loud is <unk> .
so , what do we actually want to do -- a blind person or a powerful person ?
just to think of a human being as a child , you might want to be able to give up and teach them ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open them doors ?
one person who opened for me was my friend at <unk> <unk> institute in <unk> .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> whose name , as you can think of , most americans couldn &apos;t correct properly , so he was always called dr. sheep .
and dr. watson used to fly very <unk> and was just created for kids with kids .
i found the time i spent in this hospital just great -- until my <unk> .
i had to share with an infinite amount of infinite times with these <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- that you know , to build my <unk> , and i have these <unk> more than anything else . i put them in . i swear them . i hated them .
and imagine , actually , when i was a <unk> kid with dr. <unk> , trying to stop that kind of effort without success .
and one day he looked at me with one of my favorites -- these were just <unk> and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;ll one day get one of those little <unk> .
and if you do , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
so , of course , this was just a simple trick from dr. lanka , so i make the tools that i didn &apos;t want to do , which is to make sure that , in fact , in the second day , in the second frog , he actually brought me to be able to see my daily <unk> with new eyes , so that was a new and <unk> experience .
and i wonder today , as much as his vision of me as strong and powerful young girls , and i could think of myself as one of nature &apos;s strong , powerful and <unk> person .
this is just one example of many , how adults are able to do the imagination of a child .
but for example , examples of the <unk> prove that we don &apos;t tell us our language to imagine something that we would all wish : to allow each individual to see themselves as powerful people .
our language <unk> the social changes in many cases , through a technological change .
of course , from the medical point of view , of course , you can say that my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> of titan and artificial <unk> for the <unk> bodies that allow people to really use their possibilities and focus on the limits that they choose .
so maybe this technological change is clear , because the fact that there was always a different truth , which is that every person in society can be something that can be very , very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt is our biggest plus .
the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people are always asking me to tell you about how i &apos;m going to talk to you , and i &apos;m going to tell you something that i &apos;m going to tell you about : this sentence has never been <unk> , and i &apos;ve always felt really excited about asking the questions of people , and i think , i think , why .
this sentence of dealing with stress lives from the idea that success or happiness depends on creating a challenge without being driven by it , as if my life was so successful , because i could go through the potential of a life with a sculpture , or whatever humans could perceive me with my disability .
but the truth is we change , of course , that we change , of course , whether it &apos;s physically , emotionally or even both .
and i want to say that that &apos;s good .
there &apos;s no obstacle that we have to put together to make our lives better clearly .
<unk> are just our lives .
and i tend to see my shadow as my shadow .
sometimes i realize he &apos;s very close , sometimes he &apos;s barely seeing , but he &apos;s always with me .
and what i want to do with this is the impact on the <unk> of a human being .
there are kinds of challenges in life and challenges , and those are just real real things , and each person is different with it , but the question is not whether we &apos;re clear or not , but how we get to it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for responsible for the people that we love to keep in front of us , but they &apos;re also trying to get sure .
and we don &apos;t like our kids to feel like we can &apos;t adapt to them .
you have to separate two things : one of the medical fact : one of the medical fact that i think is the social opinion about whether i am or not .
and to be honest , the only real and profound disability that i needed to sit apart is that the world is constantly <unk> , and they can describe me with these calculations .
in our desire to protect the people who care about us , and give them the cold , hard truth about their health care , or even give a cure to the quality of the quality they expected , we have to assume that we don &apos;t have to make sure that somebody is actually <unk> .
maybe the most exciting concept is that it &apos;s just what &apos;s broken in a broken , and how we fix that , for every single one of a greater disability than one .
if we don &apos;t treat humans , and not treat all its forces and opportunities , we create in addition to the natural struggle that you might have to have , another disease .
we have a person who has value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the <unk> and look at all of human possibilities .
but most importantly , it is between perception and our great <unk> , a connection .
we shouldn &apos;t <unk> those <unk> times , or we should not try to avoid them , we should not try them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about understanding the odds .
i think it may be more to make sure that we don &apos;t necessarily have to get rid of it , but that we are open for them to put them on the <unk> , and maybe even use it to dance .
and maybe we can do it as something natural , <unk> and useful and feel useful to us in their presence .
this year , we celebrate 200 . birthday of charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin in my eyes , in something very true in the human character .
i would argue this way : not the most powerful of his species , and also not the <unk> of his way , but who can adapt to change .
from conflict , creativity .
it &apos;s not just darwin &apos;s work that we know that the ability to survive and to survive , the struggle of the human mind , is to move through conflicts .
so again , change , change , are the great skills of humans .
and maybe we just know what wood are <unk> when we &apos;re really <unk> .
perhaps that is the sense of desire , a perception of the spirit , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we can give a new meaning that is beyond heavy times .
maybe we can see things as change .
there &apos;s a change for change that we haven &apos;t developed yet .
i think the biggest damage we have ourselves , is to believe that we should be normal .
so , who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
we have the usual . the typical . but not the normal . and if you really want to know that poor person person , if you really had ?
i don &apos;t think so .
it would be great if we had this paradigm of <unk> against a different kind of possibilities or strength , in order to make it even a little bit more dangerous , we can use the forces of very many children , and they invite to engage their very special and meaningful skills .
<unk> have found that we have always found people from members of our society , to be useful and to afford a contribution .
there are evidence that already the neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , older people and people with heavy physical injuries , and that &apos;s what happened , perhaps , because people in the <unk> of these people were valuable to society .
they didn &apos;t have these people as broken and sounds ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a couple of years ago , i went to the city where i grew up in a <unk> in the red zone in pennsylvania , and i was standing in front of a <unk> .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear , like a guy behind me , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not anonymous newton . &quot;
and i &apos;m looking around and i see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , you know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you may not remember me .
when i first saw her , i took her from her mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
oh , yeah .
and of course , it was made .
this was dr. <unk> , a man i only knew from my mother &apos;s stories , because i was , of course , typical , at my birthday two weeks .
the doctor on my mother &apos;s father &apos;s birthday , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet moved to them , and i only had a few toes on that one , and a few toes on the other foot , he was the <unk> , that strangers had to be the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to say to your parents that you never would walk , and never have to be as <unk> as other kids or that you never could have an independent life , and since then you just lie at me . &quot;
it was really extraordinary that i found that he had collected my entire childhood , whether i won in the second grade in the second grade , whether i was in the second grade with the <unk> on the street , whether i was going to see my grandfather or one of my <unk> <unk> , and he used these clips to teach his students , <unk> from <unk> medical school and medical school .
and he called that part by the x factor , the potential of the human being .
you can &apos;t emphasize enough about how critical this factor for quality of life can be .
and dr. <unk> said to him , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if you haven &apos;t told anything else , and even if you just get a little bit of support , if you give kids a lot , kids can do a lot . &quot;
look , dr. <unk> has changed his thinking .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone is making two different things .
and also , i &apos;ve changed my thinking over time if i had asked me at the age of 15 , whether i had my gun against legs from meat and bones , i wouldn &apos;t have a second .
i didn &apos;t want to be normal .
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not sure .
and this is what happens because i experienced something with my legs and not despite that experience .
and maybe this change is happening , because i &apos;ve met so many people who have opened me doors instead of looking at people who were taught me , or give me an idea .
you see , it &apos;s really just one person who shows you how you can <unk> your forces , and you &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to activate your own inner forces , the human mind is so <unk> -- if you can do that , and for somebody in a moment you open a door , you &apos;re a very good teacher for these people .
they teach them to open doors themselves .
the real meaning of &quot; <unk> &quot; in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means something that creates potential to do that .
again , what potential do we want to do ?
in the &apos; 60s , britain was done in the u.k. , and then they were <unk> in <unk> .
they call it &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the united states . &quot;
the students are separated for notes .
and the one students get harder harder , the better teachers get and so forth .
they then gave me a <unk> period of students with a &quot; good guy , &quot; they told them they were very smart , and they were very smart after these three months .
and of course , to tell you that the heart was told , they were just enough .
and anyway , it was the three months .
but only those who were still in school -- besides the students who had <unk> school .
the key thing about this study was that teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they simply told them that they were the <unk> , and they are the students with the nurse , and they also taught them something and treated them .
the only real disability is a <unk> mind that has been broken , has no hope . he doesn &apos;t find any hope . he doesn &apos;t find anything that doesn &apos;t have any more <unk> to it , including our natural , <unk> and our <unk> ability of imagination .
but if we create the human mind to support the human mind , to hope , self and other people around them are beautiful , curious and <unk> , we &apos;re actually putting our forces in a really positive way .
if there &apos;s a mind about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new <unk> .
i &apos;d like to end with a poem that was written by a poet named <unk> in the 18th century , and it was told by my friend martin <unk> , and the poem is called , &quot; the god who knows only four words : &quot; come with me . &quot;
come on , dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
suppose i said , through a few changes of your genes , you could have a better memory -- more and more closely and faster .
or would you like to be more powerful , more power .
do you want to be more attractive and more powerful ?
what about life longer ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of them who are always looking for more creativity .
which one would you like most ?
which one would you like to have if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably as many as there are creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would you choose for a good memory ?
a few more .
what about autism ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like that as a doctor .
if you could only have one , it would be a very different world .
is it all <unk> ?
or is it possible ?
evolution has been a <unk> topic here on ted , but today i want to give you the view of a doctor to the subject .
the great <unk> in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was also a <unk> in the russian <unk> church , once wrote a paper called &quot; nothing in biology makes no sense of evolution except at evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who aren &apos;t going to accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time , you take over it , take your personal <unk> -- i &apos;ll give you permission -- and maybe you can look at <unk> <unk> &apos;s book , which is to be wrong , because nothing in the rest of this talk will make sense for you .
but if you accept biological evolution , remember this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it true for others , or is it about us ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
in this picture , i have a bush as a center of <unk> in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all of the existing <unk> on the edges of these branches have been successful in evolutionary terms : they have survived ; it has its environment and strength .
the human part of this <unk> , far at the end , is what we &apos;re most interested in .
we moved from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , there may be 20 or 25 different types of sharks .
some have come and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> years .
it seems like we were right now by the other parts of life , but in fact , for the most part , the basic mechanisms are our cells quite equal .
do you realize that we can use it from that and create the mechanisms of a shared bacteria to produce the protein of the human brain , which is used to treat <unk> ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that &apos;s <unk> <unk> of what comes out of .
and as we talk about bacteria , are you aware that each of us in our gut do more bacteria than cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times .
i mean , do you think , when charlie comes to your mind , do you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful <unk> environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm ; it &apos;s dark ; it &apos;s very intuitive .
and you &apos;re going to give you all the nutrients you wish you could only wish without effort .
it &apos;s really a easier way for bacteria , with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
but otherwise , you &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they matter to their lives .
they help the waste nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will happen in the future ?
are we in some kind of <unk> balance in the form of a species ?
or are we going to be something else -- something which is perhaps better about the environment ?
now let &apos;s take a step back to the era of the big bang 14 years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four billion years ago -- the first signs of living living species , maybe three or four billion years ago on earth -- the first <unk> organisms , perhaps so much than 800 or a billion years -- and then the human species that <unk> over the last few years .
in this huge <unk> symphony of the universe , life on earth is only short ; the animal animal , like a single child ; and of the human life , a little <unk> .
we were .
this also represents the <unk> of this speech , which is why i hope d has liked them .
now , when i was in college , i had my first <unk> .
i was fascinated by the absence and beauty of biology .
i was interested in the power of evolution , and i thought , something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in <unk> organisms , every cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is going to continue to move around .
but at the time when <unk> organisms began to change things .
sexual origins starts to picture .
and importantly importantly , with the introduction of sexual power to the genome , the rest of the body is <unk> .
in fact , you could say that the <unk> of death of the death of the death of our body in the same moment as well as sexual power .
now , i have to say , if i was a <unk> , i thought , okay , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty close to the time , but with every year it has come to my international conclusion .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george <unk> , who did his show in las vegas his show in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a wire on his <unk> .
he opens the door .
he &apos;s a beautiful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i will take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization that i was a doctor that i had a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not necessarily <unk> , only different .
i tried to keep the body .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i wanted to get the health for a disease .
i wanted us to have a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the <unk> of the genome to the next generation , ethiopia and survival generation to generation .
from a evolutionary standpoint , they are , and i &apos;ve been developing <unk> rockets to send genetic <unk> into the next stage of the orbit to get to the sea .
i think we &apos;d all be able to understand all of the mood that all of us could get to expression when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to learn through my work .
i want to do it by not chinese . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean to prefer the longest life .
it &apos;s not necessarily the biggest , the most successful or the fastest , and not even the <unk> .
evolution <unk> the creatures that adapt the best to their environment .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
so , in the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there , which are <unk> , and by doing that , if fish were there , there would be hundreds of tons of fish going on , yet they managed to have a global environment for themselves .
so , what does that mean when we look at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about space human beings , and most importantly , in the next phase , i would say there &apos;s a number of possibilities .
the first is we &apos;re not going to move .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the reasons would be that , first of medicine , we managed to have a lot of genes that have otherwise been <unk> and had been removed from the population .
and secondly , we as a species evolved to our environment , that we managed to adapt to us right now .
and by the way , we &apos;re going , and in the way , we &apos;re going forward , and we &apos;ve got so much that they can &apos;t tell us that compassion is necessary for evolution , for evolution , for survival .
a second possibility is that it &apos;s going to be a evolution of traditional species , of course , by the forces of nature .
and the argument is that there would be the wheels of evolution slowly , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and that &apos;s how , you know , if we look as species of distant planets , there will be huge and changes in the environment that evolution could produce in natural ways .
but there is a third possibility , a <unk> and fascinating opportunity .
i call it <unk> -- the new development that isn &apos;t easy , of course , but led us and decided to be a <unk> in the decisions we make .
now , how could that happen ?
how could it be that we do this ?
let &apos;s start looking at the reality that people today , in some cultures make decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and family decide .
so think , if it &apos;s not only possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to choose genetic damage that disease would cure and prevent disease .
what if they could make the genetic changes to grow diabetes , or alzheimer &apos;s , or reduce the growth of the <unk> or <unk> ?
wouldn &apos;t they want to make these changes in their genes ?
if we <unk> , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project began in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost <unk> billion dollars .
last year when it was done in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in <unk> to four months .
today , you can take a sequence of the three billion parts of the human genome to a price of about $ 20,000 and in the space of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take a long time to reality that it will be the 1,000 $ human genome , and it will be increasingly available for everyone .
a week ago , at the national academy of engineering , the <unk> prize for francis <unk> and <unk> <unk> , two scientists , which evolved independent apart , developed the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead proteins in a more dramatic way -- which is called &quot; direct evolution . &quot;
a few years ago , the scientist of the scientist , <unk> <unk> , for his research in which he took a adult <unk> , was a <unk> , and by using only four genes , the cell <unk> to a <unk> cell -- a cell able to be able to get any cell in your body .
these changes come in .
the same technology that makes the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that cannot only protect themselves , but can also serve against other viruses .
whether or not you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in the gang that has been <unk> in the cells .
can you imagine something good that comes from kyoto ?
this is all reality , and in the future today , it &apos;s going to be much more possible .
imagine just two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your wallet ?
what if you could change the bottle and the <unk> or the <unk> egg to provide your children a better chance for a <unk> life , the diabetes , the <unk> , the <unk> , the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want to save kids ?
and then the <unk> technique , the same engine of science can allow the changes to prevent disease , could also prevent us to <unk> , <unk> -- better memory .
why don &apos;t you have the <unk> of a scientist <unk> <unk> , especially if you can expand it with the next generation of <unk> ?
why not have the fast <unk> that allow them to run faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
these are <unk> .
and if we &apos;re in a place where we can move it to the next generation , and we can be able to identify the <unk> that we want , we &apos;re going to be <unk> by <unk> evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that requires 100,000 years , and we can reach it to a thousand years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions with whom their grandchildren , or their grandchildren .
are we using these decisions to form a society which is better , is the more successful one ?
or are we going to choose some different traits that we want for some of us and not for others ?
will we form a society that is <unk> and <unk> , or <unk> and <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions that we need to face .
and most of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom and the wisdom that we need to make these decisions ?
in good words like evil , and earlier , as you might think , these decisions will be in us .
thank you .
what i want you to imagine is that you &apos;re going to imagine a three-dimensional robot that helps you <unk> skills , or another that helps you to go back and walk again .
we at berkeley <unk> call these robots <unk> .
they &apos;re not other than something they &apos;re doing in the morning , and that gives you extra strength , and that will continue to increase your pace , and will help you to keep your balance .
this is actually the real nature of human and machine .
but not only that -- and connect with the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
so to show you now what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re going to start talking about the american soldiers , which is about 100 pounds on its back , and it &apos;s going to make the claim that you should carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major destruction -- <unk> , 30 percent of it -- chronic <unk> .
so we thought that we would think of this challenge and create a <unk> that would help us deal with this problem .
so let me now introduce you to <unk> -- or to the lack of universal <unk> .
soldier : i can carry 200 pounds on <unk> terrain , for many hours .
his artistic design allows you to <unk> deeply and highly <unk> movements .
it feels what i want to do where i want to go and expand my strength and repair .
we &apos;re on as far as we introduce this device to imagine this device in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now let &apos;s look at our <unk> , something i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are thousands of millions of people living around the world in a wheelchair .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we often talk about very young individuals here who live in the <unk> of their lives -- in fact , in &apos; 30s , their own destiny , and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the elderly population whose number of themselves .
and that &apos;s how the only option -- when it comes to you , or the other -- is wheelchair .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been around for 500 years since i &apos;ve got to say , very successful .
so we thought we could start writing a completely new chapter in mobility .
let me now introduce you to <unk> , which is called by amanda <unk> , who , 19 years ago , was one of the things that they couldn &apos;t run longer for 19 years , until now .
thank you .
as i said , our <unk> is <unk> .
it has sensors .
his fully <unk> sensors in the 30s , the signals <unk> on our <unk> , which is on their back .
here &apos;s also <unk> , the <unk> is at its <unk> , as much as their <unk> , that they move forward to this very <unk> and very natural size .
i was 24 years old , and in <unk> , when a <unk> <unk> was <unk> me .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement underneath my <unk> .
not too long after that , a doctor and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go again . &quot;
and this was 19 years ago .
it <unk> every <unk> hope from my consciousness .
<unk> technologies took me since then to learn to drive again , to climb , to climb , even with the hands .
but nothing was invented to go back to me until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential here to change the life of future generations -- not just for soldiers , or amanda here and all the <unk> , but for everyone .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m the head of a nonprofit organization called nick .
if i don &apos;t get rid of poverty , i <unk> as a <unk> <unk> at a volunteer <unk> .
now , in our city , in the volunteers , the volunteers has to be <unk> , you have to be pretty early on the <unk> to be able to <unk> .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteers at <unk> , so i had a pretty good opportunity in it .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to reach and figure out what our tasks would be .
when i found the <unk> , he just had just had one of the worst conversation of her life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she was standing in <unk> , and she stood under a screen outside in the <unk> rain while her house was in fire .
the other volunteers who arrived in front of me was -- call him <unk> luther -- first the <unk> first first thing and became asked to save the house and save the dog .
the dog ! i was <unk> .
there was some lawyer or <unk> who now could tell people that he went to a <unk> house to save a living living , only because he was five seconds faster than i was .
well , i was the next one .
the <unk> <unk> me .
he said , &quot; well , you &apos;ve got to go to the house .
they have to go up to the fire , and they have to get a few shoes . &quot;
i swear it .
well , not exactly what i was going to do , but i went on -- the stairs up , the hall along , the &quot; real &quot; <unk> , which at that moment was already ready to get a few shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i put my fingers back down , where i met the door of my <unk> and the wonderful dog .
we sent our wisdom to outside the <unk> , where , not surprisingly , of his much more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , a letter received a letter from the <unk> where she was interested in her house for her house .
one thing about all sorts of common kindness : somebody had brought her a few shoes .
both in my career at my <unk> , as well as a scientist , i &apos;m talking about generosity and kindness on a large scale , but i also see the <unk> and the <unk> of individuals .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i see myself in this room and see people who either have reached a <unk> success or on your way there , i want to give you memory : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait for making a difference in life else until they reached their first million .
if you have something to give , you have it now .
put them in a <unk> , put a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day will give us an opportunity to save a human life , but every day offers us a chance to change one .
so they put off ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i just come back from a community that knows the secret to humanity &apos;s secret .
a place where women lead to the <unk> , sex &apos; hello , and the game certainly -- where fun is a serious thing .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their leaders .
this is the world of wild bonobos in congo .
bonobos are combined with chimpanzees our next living relatives .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago .
now chimpanzees are known for their <unk> .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of <unk> in human evolution .
but let &apos;s add the other side of the mall .
while chimpanzees are being <unk> by chimpanzees , the <unk> of <unk> female .
they really have something that came out , because this leads to a <unk> society where chronic violence hasn &apos;t been seen .
but unfortunately , bonobos are familiar with the primates .
they live in the deep depths of the <unk> , and the observation are very difficult to use .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness itself -- the <unk> of a violent argument that has lived for decades and nearly so many lives as the first world war .
it &apos;s not surprising that these destruction also survive .
<unk> and the decline of the <unk> lead to you that you could not fill up with the <unk> bonobos -- and even we &apos;re not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a <unk> laugh for the trees .
who are these ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war , &quot; because they have <unk> , <unk> sex , with <unk> partners , and rules like conflict and social <unk> .
i &apos;m not saying that this would be the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because life is made out of more than the <unk> <unk> .
bonobos -- like people -- love to play their lives long .
game is not just <unk> .
for us , and it &apos;s essential to the balance of relationships and the care of tolerance .
we learn trust and the rules of the game .
play makes creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the creation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and when you look at the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human <unk> , dance and rituals .
play is the <unk> that <unk> us .
now , i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you some unique footage from the wild .
first of all , a <unk> on <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think about <unk> .
so here &apos;s a young female and male in a <unk> .
look at what she does .
this could be the evolutionary source of evolutionary source , &quot; put it on the eggs . &quot;
i just think it likes him , right ?
yeah !
so <unk> are common , both in bonobos and in humans .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows you the <unk> where you &apos;re bringing new elements into the game -- like the <unk> -- and also how the game both trust and trust -- while at the same time makes fun fun .
but the game is a <unk> .
play is a <unk> , and it can assume many shapes that some of which are <unk> , <unk> , curious -- maybe to discover the final again .
and i want to show you , this is <unk> , a young female , and she &apos;s playing with water .
i think just as we play alone , and we <unk> boundaries of our inner and virtual worlds .
and it &apos;s this mysterious curiosity that lets us explore , and interact , and the unexpected things that we form are the real <unk> of creativity .
this is just a little <unk> on the insights that inspire us into our past and present .
but it also true a secret to our future , a future where we need to adapt to the challenge in which we need to adapt to more creativity , to greater creativity and <unk> that cooperation .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our <unk> .
to succeed , to succeed , we need to play .
but are we going to do the best of our <unk> ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and humans , life does not live from teeth and <unk> alone .
now , in fact , if it seems impossible , game might be at <unk> .
and so my <unk> , let &apos;s give us this gift of evolution and work together as we creativity creativity and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two squares , in the middle of 1960 , on the very same day , every single minute , every single baby -- okay .
so two pairs , every one of the baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time looking at the <unk> because , if you look at all the time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
just imagine that for a moment .
and in this particular scenario , you can imagine that , in a case , if you &apos;re wearing y <unk> , which hits the x chromosome of the limb .
and in the other case , there &apos;s a x chromosome that hits the x chromosome of the <unk> .
both are <unk> , both dancing .
we &apos;ll come back to these guys later .
most of my research i &apos;ve come up with .
under a hat , i work with the story of anatomy .
i &apos;m studied <unk> , and in this case , i study how people interact with anatomy -- the human body , the dark body -- how they interact with <unk> <unk> , with <unk> ; how they thought about bodies .
the other hat that i put on my work is the owner , as a <unk> -- or , as i say sometimes , as a <unk> lawyer -- of people who are patients of doctors .
in this case , i &apos;ve worked with people who have <unk> , the social norms .
so for example , i &apos;ve been working with people who have <unk> twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with <unk> -- so people who were smaller as usual .
and very often i &apos;ve worked with <unk> people whose gender is <unk> -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female <unk> .
and as general , we can use that word <unk> .
<unk> comes in many different forms .
i &apos;ll just give you a few examples of the kinds of <unk> that are not the male or female standard .
in a case , you might have someone with a <unk> , and the <unk> gene of the y <unk> , the <unk> that we all have in the middle of the stage are <unk> .
and that &apos;s why the <unk> are <unk> .
but because this individual are missing the properties to see the testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to the testosterone .
and that &apos;s called <unk> .
so a lot of testosterone , but no response to it .
as a consequence , the body evolved more to the typical female course .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she becomes a girl .
but most of the time they &apos;re going to reach puberty and their offspring grow and develop , but they don &apos;t get their period until somebody &apos;s coming out there &apos;s something different here .
and you make a few tests , and you &apos;ll find that instead of <unk> and <unk> , reality is in reality , and that she has a shadow .
it &apos;s important to understand that you might think this person might be male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something in our bodies that we call <unk> .
they are in the back part of our body .
and the <unk> places that are <unk> hormones .
most women , as i am -- i think a typical woman is not -- i don &apos;t know my real <unk> , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like me are actually on <unk> .
we produce <unk> and we talk to <unk> .
the consequence is that somebody like me actually has a brain that more <unk> was more than a woman who was born with hiv and had a <unk> .
so gender is really complicated ; they &apos;re not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some sense , they can be distributed across the entire range .
another example : a few years ago , i received the call of a 19 man who was born when a boy was born , when a boy was born , he had sex with his girlfriend , lived as a man , and he had just found out that he had <unk> and had a vote .
he had a extreme shape of a <unk> .
it has <unk> <unk> , and in the womb , its <unk> were so strong that they have essentially a male <unk> .
and as a consequence , his favorite male male , his brain was the <unk> male part of the <unk> .
and when he was born , he saw like a boy -- nobody did something .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he <unk> the doctors that doctors found him inside .
okay , just a quick example of a version of <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes , develop something called <unk> , which is <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
so gender can occur in many different ways .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s <unk> or <unk> , whether it &apos;s <unk> -- from surgeons often to the norm , is not because this is for their physical health .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why it &apos;s often been done in many different ways , because it &apos;s our social categories .
in fact , our system is based on the idea that there &apos;s a certain relationship with a certain identity .
so we have the concept that being a woman is to have a female identity ; to be a black person , means god , to have a african anatomy in terms of their own story .
so we have this terrible <unk> idea .
and if we &apos;re faced with a body that is actually something very different for us , and it tells us that in terms of these things .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about <unk> .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
now you can imagine how amazing it is then , when children are born , two people in a body .
where i had experienced most of the interest in the last time , the <unk> <unk> <unk> last year , whose gender in the <unk> world was asked in berlin .
a lot of journalists called me with the question , &quot; which test you will do to tell us whether <unk> is female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain to the journalists that there &apos;s not that test .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature is not a line for us between male and female , or between male and <unk> and female ; <unk> , we &apos;re the ones who are more than sure .
so we have a situation like , where , the further further our science , we have to admit so much more , that these categories that we &apos;ve given for smart categories , which are very simple , much more <unk> than we thought .
and that &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
it &apos;s also about race , which has been much more complicated than our <unk> .
we go into all sorts of different areas .
for example , we look at the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we going to do with the fact that we &apos;re only different from you through a few <unk> ?
as we continue to expand our science , we move increasingly into a zone of the <unk> , where we need to recognize that the <unk> categories we &apos;ve probably had too simple .
we see this in all sorts of areas of human life .
so one of the areas in which we see this to the <unk> , in our modern culture , are fighting at the beginning and the end of life .
we have hard conversations about what &apos;s going to be a body for people , so that he has a different right than the dominant life .
we have very difficult investments today -- maybe not as public as in medicine -- about when someone is dead .
our ancestors never had so hard to fight with the question when someone was dead .
you have somebody put a box under the nose , and if they moved , they haven &apos;t moved them .
if they don &apos;t move anymore , they have <unk> them .
but today , we are in a situation where we humans use <unk> organs and we want to get rid of other people .
and as a consequence , we get to fight with the really difficult question when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have as simple categories as we used to .
now you might think that all of categories someone like me was really happy .
i &apos;m politically <unk> , <unk> people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
to understand that these categories are really much more powerful than we thought , makes me worry .
and it makes me worry about democracy in terms of democracy .
so to tell you about this <unk> , first of all , i have to make sure that i &apos;m a big fan of bin .
i know they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
i think they were so <unk> and strong , and so radical , in which they were doing , that i &apos;ll look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happened with the <unk> .
the taliban were from my view , the original <unk> activists , which is why .
what she <unk> was a <unk> concept , and she was doing it by another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you all remember , there was a concept that we all remember , the concept of independence , and the monarchy was based on a very basic concept of anatomy .
the ancient world didn &apos;t have an idea based on dna , but they had a concept of <unk> .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power had to have these political power because of the <unk> <unk> from the grandfather to son and so on .
and they came back this idea , and they came back through a new concept concept , and this concept said that all human beings were created .
and what they decided to do was to do this , and decided that <unk> was seen , the common <unk> , not the differences , and it was very radical .
now they made this part because they were part of a <unk> system in which two things together .
democracy grew up , but at the same time , science grew up .
if you look at the history of characters , clearly that many of you were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a <unk> world .
they went away from the simplest <unk> way , and unexpected things like a modern concept of power , back where the transmission are based on a very <unk> basis of blindness .
they moved into a <unk> concept .
and if you look at the continents , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature &apos;s god .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , it &apos;s given us a concept that we &apos;ve been talking about .
and so they really prepared the future government .
they didn &apos;t think that way , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened then ?
for instance , for example , women who <unk> the <unk> , the concept of the creator , says that , more importantly , more important than the <unk> difference , and said , &quot; that we have a <unk> and <unk> than the difference is not important enough that we should have the right to deal with the right to do the right property , etc . , etc . &quot;
and women are successful .
next was the successful civil war , where we saw people like <unk> <unk> , who was talking about it , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> row of the <unk> , saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people have different colors that are focused on <unk> <unk> differences , again .
we see the same with <unk> .
of course , the problem is that , as we start to look at all the scales , we have to start asking why we need certain <unk> .
now , of course , of course , i &apos;d like to <unk> certain <unk> , <unk> , in our culture .
i want to give you a fish not the same rights as a human .
i don &apos;t want to say we should take away from anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> must have the right to sex their responsibilities or to marry .
so there are some <unk> that make sense to me and that we , i think , should keep .
but the challenge is to figure out what it is and why we keep them , and whether they are useful .
so let &apos;s come back to these two creatures that talk to the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in the middle of the very same day .
let &apos;s imagine that one of you , maria , three months ago , she &apos;s born on one june of 1980 .
<unk> , on the other hand , is born to the <unk> , so he &apos;s born on one march in 1980 .
just because of the fact that maria 3 months was born , they were born all sorts of three months ago -- the right to choose sex , the right to vote .
it has to wait for all of these , not because he actually has another biological age , only due to his birth .
we find other <unk> about what your rights are .
well , you realize that he &apos;s male -- even though i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s the one with <unk> -- because you think he &apos;s male , he can be <unk> , which is not going to have to worry about it .
maria , in all states , can &apos;t perceive the same right , the highest in all states , and that &apos;s the right to marry .
<unk> can marry a woman in every state , but maria can only marry a woman in a few states .
so we &apos;ve got these <unk> categories all over many ways in many ways .
and to me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science such advances in the field of anatomy is that we can reach a point where we have to admit that democracy could make a democracy based on anatomy ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time , sometimes it feels like science is doing itself .
so where do we go ?
it seems to be the culture that our culture might say , &quot; well , we &apos;ve got to pull a line somewhere , so we pull it somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people are in a very strange position .
so for example , texas at a point decided that , to marry a man means you didn &apos;t have a y , and a woman means married you had a y .
now people are not tested in their <unk> .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of the story i told you about the <unk> .
if we look at a creator of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream speech . &quot;
he says we should not ask people about &quot; their color , &quot; but after the nature of your character , &quot; and goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you get people from their <unk> ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should have rights in terms of people , because i have to admit that i know that i know a series of <unk> , probably more likely than some people i know .
i want to suggest that i probably know some <unk> <unk> , who are <unk> , smarter and <unk> decisions about their sexual relationships than some of the <unk> i know .
so how do we ask the question for the properties of the character ?
it turns out to be really hard .
and part of me wonder , what if the content of a personality was something that would be <unk> in the future -- made visible visible ?
do we really want to go to that direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it really seems important to think about the idea that the united states is to wonder thoughts about democracy .
in our quest to democracy , we &apos;ve done a really good thing , and i think we &apos;d do so well in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , for example , in iran , where a man who feels sexually to other men with death , unless he &apos;s willing to get a <unk> in which case he can stay alive .
states of these kinds of species exist .
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon that i talked about a few years ago , who had a few <unk> twins with it to separate them , partly to make a name .
but when i went to him , and i asked him why he made these surgeries -- there were high surgeries -- his answer was that in his country , these children were very bad treated , and so he had to do it .
and i said to him , &quot; well , did you remove a political tree instead of a surgery to separate it ? &quot;
the united states provide incredible ways to allow people to be the ones they are without changing the state of will change .
so i think we need to be <unk> .
all right , just to say , i want to notice that i talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like or looked at if we had more involved in the mothers .
and i want to say something radical about something radical , which is , i think there might be different kinds of insights that can give us different kinds of anatomy , <unk> , when people use <unk> .
for years , since years since i was interested in <unk> , i &apos;ve been interested in research in education .
and one of the things that i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from <unk> studies is that women , on average -- not each one , but on average -- rather , complex social relationships and health care for people who live within the group are very much attention .
and so , if we think about it , we have a interesting situation .
years ago , when i did a contract , one of my favorites , who knew my interest in feminism -- i looked at myself as a journalist , so do it -- a really profound question .
he said , &quot; tell me what &apos;s wrong . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the final question i &apos;ve ever heard .
ph is about gender <unk> , which is why there is nothing female .
but the more i thought about his question , which is so much more thought i could give it a little <unk> .
this is supposed to be called , there could be a little bit , on average , where female brains are different from male different kinds of relationships , and to worry about it .
so where the sheep were extremely willing to figure out how individuals could be protected before the state , it &apos;s possible that if we put more mothers in this concept , we have more of a concept of not just how to protect , but how we can care for each other .
and maybe that &apos;s where we need to go to the future when we think about anatomy -- less about the individual body thinking about identity and more about relationships .
so that if we can try and make a <unk> connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i &apos;ve got , i &apos;m going to do a very public laboratory , and this is : i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love being able to find an opportunity to find a different <unk> , crazy <unk> , and also to photograph and photograph in the last time .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes from second hand on <unk> and <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allows me to reduce the impact of my <unk> on the environment , and on my feet .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars are responsible for usually a good purpose ; i look quite unique ; and it does fire to my very personal <unk> .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it have my size ?
am i going to like color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers yes , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and tell you what i &apos;ve been doing for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does someone do with so many <unk> ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven bits , and that &apos;s all .
for exactly one week , everything i did in my suitcase .
i figured out that i had anything else that i might have wanted to wear if i had only once moved to palm .
and since you &apos;ve not heard of me , when the woman here at the ted conference -- that means i found a few things .
and i &apos;d just like to show you my <unk> for this week .
sounds that good ?
while i do that , i &apos;ll also give you some of the lessons i &apos;ve learned whether you believe it or not , from these <unk> , to wear nothing new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the <unk> tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost always be great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole thing , including the <unk> , introduced me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i took it all week .
td : color is a little powerful .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be bad if you &apos;re wearing <unk> pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you get other happy people .
tuesday : it &apos;s going to be totally <unk> .
i spent a lot of time in my life trying to be myself , and myself , at the same time .
just be who you are .
if you &apos;re surrounded with the right people , you &apos;re not just going to understand it , you &apos;ll appreciate it .
ng : shake your inner child .
sometimes people tell me , i look like i &apos;re playing mcdonald , or i can remember them .
i like to go and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
ss : trust is key .
if you think you &apos;re looking good in something , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think you &apos;re not good in something good , you &apos;re probably right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me that day for day .
but only when i was 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to make that quickly for you .
if you believe you &apos;re inside and you &apos;re just a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to do everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden <unk> sound .
and finally , ts : a own , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world about one , without having to say a word .
it got me over and over again when that week people came to me just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously , this doesn &apos;t fit into my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home , i &apos;ll sell it all again .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn that week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to <unk> this stuff , because the corner is still going to be a different crazy , <unk> , <unk> <unk> that only me when i love a little love and search it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good day , all together .
i have something i &apos;d like to show you .
think of it as <unk> as flying <unk> .
that &apos;s what we call <unk> design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally pink , and every boy is growing up in italy with this picture in his room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is that in the last few decades , something very interesting happened .
some time ago , if you wanted to win a formula , you took your budget and put your money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
now , if you want to win a race , if you want to win a race , something like this -- something that the car does in real time , some thousand sensors that have information from the car , this information to the system , and then they process , and then use that car to send back to decisions and things in real time during information .
this would you , in <unk> , a <unk> call .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made of two parts -- a <unk> part and a <unk> .
what &apos;s interesting today is the <unk> start in our lives .
our cities , in the last few years , are now with networks and electronics .
they become free .
and as computers , they start to respond in a different way , they &apos;re going to be considered and driven .
if we <unk> cities , that &apos;s actually a big deal .
and by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s earth , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population is living there .
they are 75 percent of the <unk> -- cause to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something about the cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
and beyond the cities , all of that sense and <unk> into objects of everyday life .
this is from a exhibition that came from a exhibition for moma later in the year , during the summer .
it &apos;s called &quot; mind with me . &quot;
now all of our objects , our environment , start to talk to us .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost as if any atom is out there , a sensor and a <unk> .
and that changes the interaction that we have with our environment .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of <unk> ...
you know , when she turned to the moses , it means that he took the hammer at the end and took it on moses -- in fact , you can still see a little spot -- and she said , &quot; <unk> <unk> ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
well today , our environment starts to answer us .
i &apos;m just going to show you just a few examples -- again , with the idea of changing our environment .
let &apos;s start with view .
now the first project i want to show you is really one of the first of our lab .
it was developed four years ago in italy .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually a new kind of network that has been used all over the world -- that &apos;s a <unk> -- and <unk> information from this network that will be collected by the <unk> to understand how the city works .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was like the <unk> won .
some of you will remember it was in italy against france , and then at the end of the day , the <unk> .
and anyway , italy ended up won .
now look at what happened that day , just watching activity that happens in the network .
here &apos;s the city .
you can see in the middle the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
the morning , before play .
you see the frequency at the top .
early afternoon , people here and there , who are making calls and moving .
the game starts -- silence .
france does a wire . italy does a rock .
<unk> , people make a short call , go to the toilet .
second <unk> . end of normal play .
first one , second .
<unk> , in a moment of <unk> .
italy wins . yeah .
now , this night , they all went to the center to celebrate .
they saw the great <unk> .
the next day , everybody went to the center to meet the <unk> and the prime minister at the same time .
and then everybody went down .
you can see the picture of the valley <unk> <unk> , where , since the time , people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you &apos;ll see that at the end of the day .
now , this is just one example of how we feel the city , in a way that we couldn &apos;t .
another example of thinking : this is not about people , but things that we use and consume .
now , we know all about where our things come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that a mac computer is how they came together .
but we just know a little bit about where things go .
so in this project , we designed some little algorithms to track the garbage as it comes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers that started to do a little bit more than a year ago , in seattle , looking at the things that they <unk> -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that they would break out .
then we have little chips , the little brands , put it on the garbage and started track it .
here are the results we &apos;ve just got .
from seattle ...
after a week .
with that information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same thing in doing less with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but this happens a lot of <unk> and complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that , when we see every day , the cup , we don &apos;t just go away , it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
and the <unk> that we &apos;re still standing there every day .
and if we were to show that people , then we can move behavior .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , <unk> <unk> , could give you a lot more about the experience and the many other wonderful things you can perceive with , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part that we &apos;re talking about at the beginning , and that &apos;s the <unk> of our environment .
and the first project is something we did in <unk> a few years ago .
it started with a question of <unk> that came to us and said that spain and <unk> have a beautiful tradition to use in public places as part of architecture .
and the question was , how could you connect technology to connect new technology ?
and one of the ideas that were faced with was on a <unk> , you can imagine this <unk> , and the <unk> , the <unk> that open and close .
it creates something like a <unk> <unk> out of water .
if these <unk> vessels , you can write on it , you can write patterns , images , text .
and you can approach it , and it &apos;s going to open up to leave you , as you can see in this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor of <unk> .
he really liked him .
and we got the mission to design a building for the expo .
we called it the digital water .
the whole building was made of water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but when you approach it , it will open and you leave it .
the roof was also covered with water .
and if it &apos;s <unk> , if you want to reduce the weight , you can even drop the roof .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture , as in this case , you know , this days , when you hit the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and saying , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t destroyed the building ; it &apos;s just that architecture disappears almost .
here &apos;s how the building works .
you see the person who asks what &apos;s going on inside inside .
and here you see me when i was trying to test the sensors that opened the water .
now , if i tell you what one night was happening to work as all sensors .
but actually it was an even greater fun at that night .
all the kids from <unk> came to the building because the way she played with the building was very different .
it wasn &apos;t longer a building that was open to leave you , but a building that still had clean and holes in the water , you had to be able to jump out without wet .
and that , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people are using things that we design .
but reality is always ubiquitous .
and this is the beauty of creating things that are used to interact with people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , the <unk> of water and the <unk> .
and this is what led us to think about the following project that i &apos;m showing you now .
imagine being able to really start flying these <unk> .
imagine if you have little cameras that flies through the air , and each of you with a little <unk> with light lights -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a <unk> , like the one you saw earlier , which is completely <unk> .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like this one -- a <unk> cell in two dimensions .
or in three dimensions , in which what changes , the light is not the position of the <unk> .
you can play with different ways .
imagine if you could just appear in different parts of the screen or sizes , in different <unk> .
but then it could only be a 3d cloud of <unk> that you can go forward and through which you move through many , many directions .
what you &apos;re looking at here is a real <unk> that uses <unk> to shape like before a <unk> .
if you switch the light , it looks like this . so the same as we saw it before .
imagine that every single one of people is being <unk> .
it could have every single person who comes from people , from the movements of people or so .
i want to show you something here .
we &apos;ve been working with <unk> <unk> , one of the great <unk> of our time -- the <unk> theater in new york , and the <unk> in beijing -- we &apos;ve taken his movements in 3d bags to use them as a tool for the <unk> .
this is <unk> dancing .
on the left you see the <unk> , the different <unk> particles .
it &apos;s also a <unk> and a <unk> .
so you can understand the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , once we all have <unk> , you can play with it and paint motion and play color .
we &apos;d like to use that as a possible impulse for the <unk> .
so i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something we work for the olympics games in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
and the idea is , again , imagine that this is what we &apos;re doing again with people to do something and to change the environment -- almost something like what we call <unk> <unk> , but with a cloud .
imagine that every single <unk> can give you a <unk> .
i think that &apos;s remarkable of the last few years , the last decades that we are from a physical world to a digital world .
this has all been <unk> , knowledge , and power through the internet .
now , for the first time , we can -- and the campaign announced has shown this -- we can go from the digital world , from the digital forces of networks to the physical world .
that can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
that is called something in the city .
but tomorrow , to ask us the next challenges -- think about the climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we change from the digital world to physical change .
so the idea is that we actually bring the people together in which they do things together .
the cloud is again a cloud of <unk> , in the same way that a real cloud is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> shape in london , but with <unk> covered .
they can move inside and different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , the most important moments of <unk> 2012 and you can share it as a form of connection to community .
so both of the physical cloud in the sky and some of the top you can go to the top of the top of london &apos;s new galaxies .
you can use it .
and sort of digital <unk> at night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for anyone who want to go to the top .
thank you .
as artists , i think the relationship is very important .
through my work , i try to express that people are not separate from nature , and that everything is connected to each other .
the first time i was in antarctica about 10 years ago , where i saw my first <unk> .
i was sorry .
my heart was <unk> , while i was trying to figure out what was going on .
the <unk> around me was almost 60 feet out of the water , and i was able to make sure that one was pregnant on another , year after year .
<unk> are born as a <unk> or <unk> out of <unk> .
everybody has his own individual personality .
they interact in ways with their environment and experiences .
some people get <unk> and <unk> all the way down to the <unk> , while others were no longer <unk> and in a <unk> <unk> passion .
when you look at the boat , it &apos;s easy to think that they &apos;re isolated , apart and alone , as we humans see ourselves .
but the truth is far away from that .
as a tower , i <unk> his <unk> atmosphere .
during the <unk> , it <unk> <unk> drinking water , which has a lot of life .
i &apos;m going to go into my footage of these <unk> , as if i was going to make portraits of my ancestors in the mind that they exist in these individual moments , and never again , ever again .
it &apos;s not a death when it rains ; it &apos;s not the end , it &apos;s a <unk> of your head along the cycle .
part of the ice in the <unk> i have is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and part of ice is over 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you , i &apos;ll show you a <unk> that i <unk> in <unk> in greenland .
very rare , you actually get a <unk> of a <unk> .
so here you see .
on the left you see a little boat .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
please take a look at the shape of the memory and where it &apos;s at the <unk> .
you can see here he starts to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the guy stands there .
this is the average size of a <unk> .
it &apos;s about 120 feet from the water , or 40 feet .
and that video is real .
and just so , showing you another side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really extraordinary by working on some amazing projects .
but what i &apos;ve ever been working on was this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading <unk> in the &apos; 80s .
then one day , he came back from walking and said , &quot; <unk> , my legs <unk> . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of it .
<unk> is completely paralyzed .
he can only use his eyes .
i was standing toward him .
i have a company called design and animations , so it &apos;s an complex part of what we find in the <unk> and watch .
so we decided , tony -- <unk> -- and his thing to support .
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
and i just want to go back to him and i said , &quot; wait a minute , that &apos;s not -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all be allowed to communicate with these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you &apos;ve heard higher <unk> and you &apos;ve got a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
normal people are not accessible to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
did anybody see the movie &apos; and <unk> ? &quot;
they communicate -- this is how your fingers communicate .
i &apos;m like , &quot; very <unk> , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need just a check , and instead i asked a check that i didn &apos;t know the <unk> of what i was supposed to do .
i sat in place , and then there &apos;s his brother and his father -- saying , &quot; well , my proposal is like tony &apos;s going to talk , we &apos;re going to get him a device , and we &apos;ll get a way to find that he can make his art .
because it &apos;s a claim that somebody who can &apos;t communicate this , can &apos;t communicate . &quot;
so i talked a few months later at a conference .
i met these guys at <unk> , interactive research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to put light on any surface , and then to draw with a <unk> on it , which was just the negative surface .
so they pull around and they do <unk> like this .
they say that all the things that are going on up there are a life of life .
it starts with the <unk> , and then the <unk> are coming , and finally , people actually do art .
but there was always a life in their presentation .
so i went home and ate with my wife , and told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , wait a second , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use your eyes to control things , then we should find a way to control that <unk> can control a laser , so that it would be great . &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of back and forth of things , we &apos;ve reached some things .
first of all , we &apos;ve <unk> the doors , and actually have a device for <unk> that he can communicate with -- a stephen <unk> .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him <unk> , because you talk to him , or you get email , and you &apos;re like , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot;
we also have seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to go home .
my wife , my children and i are in the garage , and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> did our house .
a lot of our friends thought we were beautiful dumb to do that , and that we <unk> and all images on walls were <unk> .
but for over two weeks , we designed , we went to the <unk> for <unk> , my kids were <unk> , my dog too , and we created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap <unk> that we bought at <unk> <unk> , a little bit of stuff out of the <unk> and the <unk> .
we took a <unk> , they <unk> , they put it on a <unk> , and now we have a device that &apos;s available -- you can build it yourself , we can build the code for free , the software can download free .
so we create a device that &apos;s completely free of limitations .
no insurance can <unk> .
no hospital either .
anyone can actually communicate with your eyes or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much . that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to <unk> room .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and this is his room .
so there &apos;s all of these <unk> before the great <unk> .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , stephen tony for the first time again .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his home system , and he &apos;s seeing his life life system .
we &apos;ve got his bed to see it outside .
we created a <unk> wall against the hospital in front of the hospital .
and he drew again for the first time , in his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what a feeling that was on the parking .
we also had to <unk> in the <unk> , so we felt a part of the <unk> .
at the end , he ended up telling us an email with amazing content , &quot; for the first time for seven years .
i feel i was growing underwater underwater , and i finally got somebody down and my head so that i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that amazing ?
this is something like our <unk> .
that keeps us in front of us and we continue to develop .
and we need to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it comes in the same way .
and someone who has a certain potential potential , much more .
so we are trying to figure out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we have all sorts of recognition .
we won a few prices .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us depend on it .
it all comes from our own pockets .
so the climbers were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> about us and then , in december , the most amazing thing we did was one of the 50 best invention in 2010 , which was really great .
the most interesting thing about this -- and this includes all the circle -- that it &apos;s this april , when <unk> <unk> in the city of los angeles , called &quot; the kind of <unk> . &quot;
and it &apos;s probably going to be pretty much the most exciting <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys are going to be there .
<unk> will be part of the show , which is pretty limited .
so basically , to me , if you look at something that &apos;s impossible , then you can do it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the <unk> -- everything was impossible .
make it possible -- all of you here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i &apos;ve never had to do anything with <unk> , but i just got a little bit of work , amazing people around it , so we could put something on the legs .
and that question is , every single day , and that question is that every single day you have to do something that needs to be done . if not now , when do i , and if i don &apos;t , who then ?
thank you .
so , i write for children , and probably america is mostly <unk> .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to come from a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody has ever chosen farmer .
i want to tell you about circles today .
well , a checklist is usually something you find because you &apos;ve lost it somewhere .
you go around the block , and you take it as an epiphany .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i want to tell you about today .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s at high school in <unk> , ohio , where i was the <unk> .
i was one who saved every week in the <unk> green and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by looking at the toilet in the <unk> .
that &apos;s what she did .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go out of town .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it took me to san francisco in california -- i found a <unk> -- and at that time in the &apos; 80s , i found it important to work at <unk> .
about three or four years ago , i got a call from this teacher , a woman who said , &quot; i &apos;ve got to see them .
i &apos;m sad that we never learned as adults .
can you come to ohio , and please come together with the man i know you found it .
and i should mention that i have <unk> , and i want you to ask yourself . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we were crying , and we knew they had to be in a <unk> .
we found one for them , we brought them down , and we sat around them , and we gave them eight , because it needed to be .
it was something we knew .
and just as the woman who wanted to learn to know me as adults , she turned into a box that was filled in my hands .
what happened was that the circle was closed , it had become a circle -- and i was talking about the epiphany that i was talking about .
the retina is , death is part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i teach her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that needs the rest of life .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this is so often mentioned today .
it needs as well -- it needs love and pleasure , and it &apos;s about giving these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion as you go to 1,000 feet .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
imagine a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> power .
that sounds scared .
well , i had a unique place that day ; i was sitting on <unk> .
i was the only one who could talk to me .
so i looked in the same way , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve caught some birds . &quot;
the pilot had already <unk> the machine , and we weren &apos;t as far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things simultaneously .
the pilot took the machine after the hudson river .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
it <unk> the load .
imagine a <unk> airplane .
and then he said three words -- the <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the <unk> .
i was able to see it in her eyes , there was bush who was at the end .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
we have this <unk> , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to get a hand and didn &apos;t do it , all the <unk> i wanted to do , all the experiences i wanted to do .
while i was thinking about this later , a phrase came to me , which is , &quot; i don &apos;t have bad pants . &quot;
because if the wine is there , and the person is there , then i open it .
i never want to move more in life .
and this <unk> , this goal really changed my life .
the second thing that i learned about that day -- and that was when we went to the george washington bridge , pretty much about <unk> -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing that i really <unk> .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity and with my mistakes , i <unk> to become better in everything i need .
but in my humanity , i also gave my ego space .
and i &apos;m looking at the time that i &apos;m doing <unk> things with people who mean something .
and i thought to my wife , to friends , to people .
and after that , when i was thinking about that , i decided to make negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i wasn &apos;t <unk> with my wife two years .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have right ; i &apos;ll be happy to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- while the inner clock is <unk> , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ... &quot;
you see the water come .
i said , &quot; please <unk> the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want that thing into 20 parts of how you know it from <unk> .
as we know , i had this feeling of dying , not dying .
almost like we were trying to prepare our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sadness really <unk> in a thought , which is that i just wish one thing .
i wish i could see my kids grow up .
about a month later , i went to my daughter -- <unk> , not much <unk> talent .
... not yet .
and i <unk> , like a little kid .
and in the world , everything makes sense to me .
i realized then by making the dots together , that life is just about being a great father .
more than anything , anything else , my only goal in life is to be a good father .
i became wonder to die in that day .
i got another gift to look into the future and to live and live differently .
my call to everybody who fly today is imagine what &apos;s going on on your flight -- please don &apos;t -- but think about it , and how would you change ?
what would you do , what would you do , because you think you &apos;re always there ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are the best parents you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> <unk> is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important piece of nuclear weapons there is <unk> in <unk> .
the gray boxes that you see here , these are <unk> .
now , if we control the systems that can control the systems and the <unk> , then we can actually create a lot of problems with this .
these gray <unk> are not running <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can do that , if we can do it that a <unk> is used on a laptop that is used by a <unk> , to <unk> these gray box , we &apos;re in business .
and this is the planning behind <unk> .
so we start with a <unk> .
they &apos;re going to be <unk> into the gray box , <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> -- mission <unk> .
this is a stick , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started <unk> our research about six months ago , completely unknown what was the point and purpose of that .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , in the <unk> part , the <unk> part , made by <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it seemed a little bit of <unk> , with these gray <unk> , these <unk> <unk> .
this <unk> our attention , and we started a <unk> project where we infected our environment with <unk> , and we studied that process .
and then something weird happened .
<unk> <unk> like a <unk> that didn &apos;t like our cheese -- <unk> , but didn &apos;t want to eat him .
that made no sense in my eyes .
and after looking at various kinds of cheese , i realized that this was a <unk> attack .
completely a particular goal .
the <unk> <unk> active active active on the gray box , if a particular one was discovered , even when the special program that it &apos;s trying to do it on this goal .
and if you don &apos;t , don &apos;t do anything .
so , that really became my interest , and we started working with it almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could be , let &apos;s say , for example , a <unk> american power , or a <unk> in germany .
so we should soon figure out what the goal is .
so , <unk> and <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> code , found that it &apos;s <unk> in two digital <unk> -- a smaller and a bigger one .
and we also noticed that they were very politically designed by people who obviously had information obviously all had information .
they knew any bits and <unk> they needed to attack .
probably , you know , even the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve already noticed that the <unk> is complex and <unk> , let me tell you , the <unk> is a science for itself .
it &apos;s much more efficient than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here &apos;s a clip from this <unk> code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines code .
it looks pretty much like <unk> <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we could be able to be smart out of this code .
so what we were looking at first was <unk> <unk> because we know what these things are .
and then we went to <unk> and <unk> and trying to connect to the physical world -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could tell .
to make these theories , let &apos;s call ourselves in memory that it &apos;s definitely <unk> , it has to act in order to act an important goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran , because most of the infections have been introduced .
well , there are not several thousand goals in this area .
basically , it goes out to the <unk> and the <unk> in <unk> .
so i said to my doctor , &quot; take me a list of all experts and power from our <unk> . &quot;
and i called them up and they know to compare their knowledge to what we found in code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible for us to connect the little digital <unk> with the <unk> .
the ph is this moving part within the <unk> , this black object that you see .
and if you put the speed of this <unk> , then you can actually be able to remove the <unk> , and finally , to let you break it down .
what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the center was to slow down and to happen and to happen -- obviously , in trying to make <unk> , so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get away quickly .
the great digital <unk> -- we got a glimpse by looking at very closely data and <unk> .
so for example , this code is very much out of this code ; you can &apos;t get it .
i started studying scientific literature , about how these <unk> are built in <unk> , and found that they were <unk> in so-called <unk> , and each <unk> contains <unk> <unk> .
so it made sense , put it together .
and it got better .
these <unk> in iran are in 15 so-called levels .
and guess what we found in the <unk> ?
it &apos;s almost identical structure .
so again , that fit really well .
and this gave us great confidence for what we study here .
now don &apos;t get me wrong , that didn &apos;t work .
these results were achieved by several weeks of hard work .
and often we just sat in a <unk> and we had to collect ourselves .
anyway , what we found was that both digital talent actually went to one and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little <unk> takes a <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> and <unk> it and <unk> it with six <unk> into interaction and <unk> .
so , in large and large , we &apos;re very confident that we actually determines what the goal is .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be hit by <unk> .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- it really took me out of the <unk> .
down there is the gray box , and up there you see the <unk> .
now , what this thing is doing is that it &apos;s the <unk> values of sensors -- like <unk> and <unk> -- and there &apos;s <unk> code that &apos;s still on the attack with false data data .
and in fact , this false <unk> data was taken before .
so it &apos;s just like in <unk> , where the <unk> is <unk> with before <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
the idea here is obviously not just the <unk> of the <unk> .
in fact , it &apos;s much dangerous and cheaper .
the idea is to do a digital <unk> .
we need digital <unk> where a human <unk> cannot respond fast enough .
so , for example , in a power station , if the big <unk> is too fast , you have to open <unk> within milliseconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human <unk> .
so this is where we need digital <unk> .
and if you &apos;re at risk , really bad things happen .
the power power can kill .
and neither the <unk> , nor will notice it .
this is scary .
but it &apos;s even worse .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . this attack is <unk> .
he has nothing special to do with <unk> , with <unk> .
so , for example , it would work just as well -- in a power station , or in a <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- but you don &apos;t have to -- you don &apos;t have to know the <unk> about a <unk> <unk> , as we saw in <unk> .
you could also use ordinary <unk> technology to spread .
you just have to spread as far as possible .
and if you do that , you eventually get a <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the consequence we have to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle east .
they lie in the united states in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the <unk> environments .
we have to ask the consequences , and we better do better at ourselves .
thank you .
i have a question .
<unk> , there was a lot of it that people think that the <unk> is the <unk> behind it .
is that your mind too ?
okay , you want to know this ?
yeah . okay .
in my opinion , it &apos;s involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force behind it is <unk> .
there &apos;s only one , and that &apos;s the united states -- fortunately , for happiness .
because our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for <unk> us . thank you .
i spent the last few years trying to place in situations that are usually very difficult and somehow dangerous .
i went to prison -- difficult .
i worked in a <unk> -- dangerous .
i shot in <unk> -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days doing nothing than this -- at the beginning , a little difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i &apos;ve been aware of most of my career looking for evil situations , and all of this is just for trying to study social spaces like this , which is interesting and interesting , and hopefully in a way that makes them fun for the audience and accessible .
so when i knew that i would come here to look at the world of <unk> and <unk> , i knew i would make something else .
some of you may have heard about me a couple of weeks ago at ebay .
i got some <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the opportunity to <unk> my tedtalk in 2011 .
really , some happy people and companies , <unk> and <unk> , have been given the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never be again -- to buy the <unk> of the talk that you &apos;re seeing right now that didn &apos;t have a lot of content , and there was a lot of evidence on what the subject would be .
so what you got was this : you name this : my tedtalk here , which you have no idea of what the subject is going to be , and that will fly to you what the ears could fly for the ears , especially if i had their company , for their <unk> stupid .
but again , it &apos;s a very good <unk> opportunity .
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a whole lot .
this is just the <unk> .
so despite that warning , i knew anybody would buy the <unk> .
now , if you asked me about this a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you about it .
but in the new project that i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising .
as i said before , i was in some pretty terrible situations over the years , but nothing was allowed to me , nothing could make me feel like anything like this in a room and walk like this .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
what i want to do is a film about <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so what we &apos;re going to see in &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; is that everything , from up to the bottom , from the beginning to the end , is completely <unk> by the <unk> , which you &apos;ll see in film , that &apos;s the brand x .
now this brand , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> center ...
these people will be connected to the film .
and so the film will study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in nigeria , forever ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
so that was more to <unk> .
it was &quot; in nigeria , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not only going to have the brand x as <unk> , but we &apos;ll make sure we &apos;ll sell any possible category in the film .
this is how we sell maybe a shoe , and it will be the greatest shoe you ever have .
the greatest car you &apos;ve ever got from &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , an attention of &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is to show apart that brands are part of the life , actually , to get them to fund the film ?
and we &apos;re actually showing the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the film .
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , from the beginning to the end .
and i would be happy if <unk> would help this .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how <unk> people are going to be .
you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use a point of view , because this has a negative <unk> -- but do you know how it &apos;s going to evolve ?
how much money is required to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet you , but i think it &apos;s worth any value , some really known brands .
who knows when the movie comes out , we might look like a <unk> <unk> .
what do you think the answer is going to be ?
the answer is most likely to be &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing for the movie or a difficult thing to me ?
ag : both .
... so , not so optimistic .
so , my husband , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about which brands .
yeah .
if you look at the people who you have to do it ...
there are some places that we can turn on .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; look at the camera , &quot; mean we wanted to lead a <unk> .
it turns out it meant really , &quot; we want to do with your film . &quot;
and just like this companies , one after the other .
no one wanted to do something with the film .
i was amazed .
they didn &apos;t want to deal with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought , the whole concept , the idea of advertising , is to make your product as many people as possible as possible .
especially in the world today , on this interface of new and old media and the <unk> media media -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new <unk> , that the masses will bring that message .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a <unk> mistake , and that was it .
actually , no , that was not the mistake at all .
it wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what that picture is , is a problem .
look , if you &apos;re transparency transparency , this is one of the first images that appears to be .
i like your way , sergey brin .
that was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and <unk> , just to discover and <unk> ; immediately , from <unk> and access to information , especially what &apos;s wrong -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re going to hear a whole lot about transparency .
our politicians say , our president says , even our french say it .
but when it comes out to be done , something changes .
but why ? well transparency is fear <unk> -- like this strange bear that still <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
and it &apos;s also very painful .
what else else ?
a whole dish cool food .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell the story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to have a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we only want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid , and my dad was taking me to lie -- and he &apos;s sitting there looking at me with this look -- he would say , &quot; my son , there are three versions of them .
there are your version , there &apos;s version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
but there &apos;s just a company that was ready to help us -- and it &apos;s just because i know john bond and richard <unk> had known for years -- i realized that i had to do it alone , i had to deal with the <unk> and directly with my team .
so what you suddenly started to understand , or what i started to understand was that , when you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , is a serious problem .
i have friends who make big , giant <unk> , and i have friends that make little <unk> like me .
and my friends , the great , giant <unk> , say that the reason why their films are so successful , is to the <unk> that they have .
and then my friends , the little <unk> are doing , &quot; well , how are we going to compete with these big , giant <unk> ? &quot;
and the movie is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so how exactly do we see the movie ?
every time i go on the road , and every time i open the <unk> , you &apos;ll see a lot of <unk> .
and every time i get somebody else , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are they far ? they look a little nervous .
i want to help you calm .
so maybe they should interview you a little bit about the interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great <unk> .
either &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; they &apos;ll have choice .
we &apos;re going to be both of men and for women as well -- <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> , whatever .
this is the <unk> .
now i can answer all of your questions and give you a <unk> .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you talked about the smaller movies , we are as brand as a brand .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so these are things -- you know , reminds people -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in .
what words would you describe ?
<unk> is <unk> .
that &apos;s a great question .
<unk> technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone else is doing .
we talk about <unk> , fresh .
i think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category really makes a difference , unlike &quot; <unk> smell and <unk> . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we hold them longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three .
those things have a <unk> effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
i have to talk to the man on the street , who are like me .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
excuse me , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i like to love beautiful clothes .
john <unk> hits <unk> , except at <unk> .
all right , what &apos;s the brand ?
unique .
i think the <unk> , the style i have , is probably &quot; <unk> glamour . &quot;
i like lots of black colors , lots of <unk> and stuff like that .
but i usually have a <unk> , like <unk> , or a toy and something like that .
if dan were a brand , he would probably be a classic <unk> <unk> .
man 2 : the brand i &apos;m , i would say , <unk> fly .
it &apos;s a woman 2 : part of the <unk> , part of <unk> -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i &apos;m adding <unk> throughout the country .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , <unk> industry .
man 4 : my brand is <unk> because i was <unk> .
man 5 : brand <unk> <unk> .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be the <unk> , but i &apos;m often looking at the interface of <unk> glamour and <unk> fly .
and what happened was i needed an expert .
i needed somebody who could fit in my head , somebody who could really help me understand what they call the &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so i found a company called <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
they have companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
if you could do it , you could also help me .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
i have . the first picture is a picture of my family .
tell me a little bit about how to deal with your thoughts and feelings about them .
these are the people who form my worldview .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the world is the world in which one lives -- like people around you , the friends , the way you live your life , work and stuff .
all of these things come in and start from a place , and for me , they start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
next . this was the beautiful day of my life .
what about the thoughts and feelings about you ?
it &apos;s the way i like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are skeptical . i like weird things .
tell me about the why &quot; why &quot; -- what do you do ?
what &apos;s the <unk> ? what &apos;s currently about ?
why is it important ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about that part .
a little bit more about you , not you .
what else are they doing ?
... it doesn &apos;t have to be fear . in what kind of york are you ?
<unk> ! no , thank you !
thank you very much .
yeah . all right .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen .
pretty many crazy things went on .
the first thing that i saw was this idea that their two <unk> , but <unk> pages -- the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> / <unk> brand .
it &apos;s very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with that .
and i think some companies will focus on a strength , rather than both of them .
a lot of companies tend to do -- and this is human nature -- things where they &apos;re not sure , they &apos;re afraid to avoid those elements , and that they turn them into something positive , and that &apos;s a <unk> .
what other brands do ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can see it here , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
well , there are <unk> brands and <unk> brands , these things that come and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is quite strong .
a <unk> , <unk> brand . how is your brand ?
if someone asked you to describe your <unk> , your <unk> , what would you be ?
you &apos;re a <unk> ? are you something that drives blood in <unk> ?
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are you something that is a little bit <unk> , <unk> ?
<unk> are things that are designed , fresh like the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> like <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are they <unk> and <unk> like <unk> ?
are you <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you know ?
are you <unk> , stable , <unk> , safe , <unk> , <unk> and wise like the dalai lama or <unk> ?
over the film , we had more than 500 companies who were getting up and <unk> and the &quot; no , &quot; because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to deal with this film , because they had no control ; they don &apos;t have control .
but it &apos;s going to find 17 <unk> who were willing to come up with these control , who wanted to do business with somebody who wanted to do business with someone like me , and who eventually told us to tell stories that we wouldn &apos;t have usually tell -- stories that would never support a <unk> .
it <unk> us to tell the story of the <unk> , the way we tell the story in this movie , that you use <unk> <unk> to try and make advertising and movies .
we went to northern ireland , where <unk> was raped .
there &apos;s been no poster in the entire city for five years , no poster , no <unk> , nothing .
and we went to <unk> , where companies are <unk> their way into <unk> schools in all of america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects of which i received most of the feedback , or where i succeeded the biggest success , are the ones where i go directly with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the <unk> , and they said that they might not really have their interest in sense .
i &apos;m going to cross the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and make something completely different , something that people will think of as a result of our world .
and how did that work for you ? what it succeeded ?
now , since the movie was finished by the <unk> film , we can look at it .
according to <unk> , the <unk> was in january , and since -- and this isn &apos;t even the whole thing -- there were dozens of millions of <unk> of this film .
that &apos;s actually only one period of two weeks ago .
this is just online -- no press , no tv .
the film hasn &apos;t been yet .
there &apos;s not even online . no <unk> .
he hasn &apos;t come out in other countries .
well , finally , the film has a very , very large level .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project that almost every <unk> that we talked about , their clients , had a client .
one of the things i found out is that if you take your chance to get risks in these risks .
i think if you get people from that , then you get them closer to failure .
i think if you trained your employees to avoid risks , you &apos;ve prepared the whole company to get a profit .
i feel like we have to encourage people to take risks .
we have to encourage people not to have fear of opportunities that they might be <unk> .
finally , we should welcome fear of fear .
we should put it in the cage .
they welcome fear . they welcome the risk .
each one of the big <unk> full of light , we called the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever , it brings us a little bit closer .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my modern talk , &quot; call transparency &quot; was told you by my good friends of <unk> , the $ $ ebay for the <unk> .
big data will be transformed for organizations around the world in large opportunities .
<unk> : &quot; they &apos;re transparency
thank you .
now , uh , on the name of transparency , this is : what &apos;s going on with the $ $ <unk> ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i put a check in my pocket , in my pocket , on the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> -- a check in altitude of dollars in order to fund my next year .
my name is <unk> .
18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i was doing something to do with museums and art . my <unk> , who is today , gave me green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the list .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and her access .
i grew up in india .
i became a great training -- i didn &apos;t care -- but i didn &apos;t have access to many museums , and this was no access .
so when i went to school , i started to learn a lot .
and while i was working for google , i tried to make this desire -- to make art with technology .
we then created a team , a great team , and we started this .
i &apos;ll start with the demonstration , and some interesting things that happened since the beginning .
so you go to <unk> .
you can see here in all these museums .
there &apos;s the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , the van valley .
i even come in one of my favorite , the contemporary museum of art in new york .
you come in two ways -- very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , you &apos;re in the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- electrons , mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
you go around and spread .
you want to be in the museum ?
open the map , and jump with a click .
in fact , you want to go to the end of the hospital .
just further . a lot of fun .
<unk> it .
thank you , but the best part .
now , i am in front of one of my favorite , <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
i see this <unk> .
if the museum gave us the picture , click on it .
this is one of the images .
these are all <unk> .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i &apos;m now moving away .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve described with the so-called <unk> .
for example , this picture has about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion ? &quot;
this is what i &apos;m going to show you .
you can <unk> it very easily .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is inevitable .
but then you really want to get deep in .
and so i started playing around around , and i found that there was something going on there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close , and i realized slowly that these kids actually felt something .
i was doing a little bit , talking to some familiar at the meeting , and actually found it &apos;s a game called <unk> , where a <unk> would hit a stick on a stick .
it was quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to be really close , you can go to the <unk> .
just to give you the idea of what i &apos;m looking for , so you can see what you get .
here we are , and this is the painting .
the best part is there -- in a second .
let &apos;s quickly jump back to moma , again in new york .
another <unk> of mine , <unk> .
for instance , it was about finding details .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
and what happens is , what if you want to see van gogh this tool ?
you <unk> . you can actually go in .
i &apos;m going to zoom into one of my favorite pictures of this picture , until i really am at the u.n. .
this is <unk> , probably never seen this before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many more , but i don &apos;t have time .
that &apos;s the really cool part , it &apos;s called y .
each of you , everyone -- whether rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go back and create your own museum -- all of these pictures can take your own collection .
just , you go in -- and i created this , it &apos;s called the power of the <unk> -- you can <unk> .
that &apos;s the <unk> , in the <unk> .
you can put it all together and send your friends , and you start with a conversation about what you feel when you look at this cartoon .
i think finally , for me , the fact that all the wonderful things here won &apos;t come from google .
they don &apos;t even come from the museums .
i might not say that .
they come from artists .
and that was an experience for me .
i mean , i hope we &apos;ll be able to do art with this digital medium of art , and you represent online online .
this is the biggest question that i &apos;ve been asked to say , &quot; did you do that to replicate the experience of a <unk> ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to be the experience .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a picture of your brain . your brain can be brought into two inches .
this is the left half , which is the logical side , and then half the right half is .
if we had a scale to measure the <unk> , we could map your brain .
for example , this person would be completely helpful .
this would be somebody who is completely intuitive .
now , where would you put your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have decided to be one of these extreme , but i think , for most people in the audience , your brain is something like this -- with high <unk> , which is at the same time .
it &apos;s not as if they &apos;re both <unk> or something .
they can be logical and intuitive .
and so , as one of the people , together with the most amazing <unk> , who need a good amount of logic to add the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good amount of intuition to actually do experiments .
how do we develop these intuition ? well , we love playing with things .
so we go out and play with it , and then we see it , and then we start developing our intuition .
basically they do the same thing .
so one of the reasons they developed over the years is probably one thing at the same time can only be in one place .
i mean , it can sound strange to think that one thing at the same time is in two different places , but they were not born with this idea ; they developed it .
i remember watching a kid playing on a <unk> .
he was still a <unk> , and he fell all the time .
but i bet that it taught him to play a very valuable lesson , which is that big things don &apos;t just leave you over and stay in place .
and this is a great <unk> model in the world , as long as you can &apos;t .
it would be a bad model for a <unk> because it doesn &apos;t play with <unk> , but with these little strange particles .
and when they play with their particles , they put all kinds of weird things -- like they fly right through walls , or that they can be at the same time in two different places .
and so they all wrote these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
that was the state of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe small particles .
but you don &apos;t need them to describe the big everyday objects around us .
it didn &apos;t work my intuition , and maybe it &apos;s just because i don &apos;t often play with particles .
well , i &apos;ll play with you , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , no one ever saw a particles .
but i didn &apos;t like it .
because if all things are made of particles , and all of these particles follow the rules of quantum mechanics , then simply not simply should follow the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why that should be that .
so i would feel better with the whole thing , if we could sort of show that there &apos;s also the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i went back a few years ago doing that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see that was in the <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see that green dot there in the middle .
that &apos;s the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
here i am doing something . we &apos;re looking at the center here .
and here &apos;s a really big representation of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal that &apos;s kind of shaped , and it &apos;s over the edge .
so i made this thing in a similar way to make a computer chip .
i went to a virtual space with new <unk> , and for 100 hours of all the big devices .
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this kind of <unk> hole and get this thing .
this thing has the ability to have the ability to be in the <unk> , but it needs a little help to do it .
look , let me give you a analogy .
you know what it &apos;s like to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m alone alone , i do all kinds of weird things , but then other people get there , and i &apos;m listening to all of these things because i don &apos;t want to leave it with it , or , frankly , they &apos;re <unk> .
quantum mechanics says <unk> objects are the same .
it &apos;s not just human beings , it &apos;s not just humans , it &apos;s the light that seems to you on them and the wind and the heat of space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal was <unk> , we had to put all the <unk> out out there .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we put the light on it , put it in a vacuum and <unk> it all the air , and it <unk> it up until now , entirely alone , the piece of metal is free to behave as it always wanted .
so we measured its movement .
we found that it &apos;s really strange moving .
instead of making it just quiet there , it <unk> . the way it <unk> was something like this -- like a <unk> and together <unk> .
in which we gave him a little bit of <unk> , we were able to measure it up to the same time and not repair -- something that is just in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about is something that is truly fantastic .
what does it mean for an object at the same time and not <unk> ?
let &apos;s think about atoms .
so the first case : all the <unk> atoms that make the piece of metal are still there , and at the same time , the same atoms are moving up and down .
it &apos;s just too <unk> voices .
the rest of the time , they are <unk> .
that means that every atom at the same time is at two different places , which means that the entire piece of metal is in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth me for all this year in the perfect room , because , if you look at this , the <unk> between a single atom and this piece of metal is about the same as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be in two different places , this piece of metal can be in two different places , why not ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical page says .
so , imagine if you were at the same time in several places , how would that feel ?
what would your mind mean that your body is in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect in history .
when we looked at it , the light <unk> and the box <unk> , we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator are really just <unk> objects that are in a small room together .
you hear a lot about how quantum mechanics is all connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more behind it , it goes deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections , with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and this is the <unk> and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should think about economic development as we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that when families think about where they live and work , they want to give them the possibility of being given at least one hand full of different cities that are all in competition around new residents .
right now we are far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries that don &apos;t even have a single city to welcome them .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they are so much more worth than building them .
so we could just <unk> the world very easily , maybe hundreds of new cities .
now this may sound absurd for you , if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
just take the building of homes against cities .
imagine that half of the people who want to live in houses , this is already ; the other half didn &apos;t .
they could try to expand the capacity of the already existing apartments .
but , you know , what you would find is that , in these homes , in these homes and their environment , you know , the environment , you know , we need to avoid laws and suffering from the natural community .
so it turns out to be very hard to get rid of all of these things .
but you could go to a completely new place , a whole new building building , and then the laws would support you such a building and not cut it .
so i &apos;ve proposed that governments create new areas that provide enough space for a city and gave them a name : <unk> cities .
later , i found out that maybe around the same time , <unk> and <unk> have thought about the challenge of conservation in neuroscience .
they knew that every year , about <unk> , their country went to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same thing .
at this point , <unk> has said to <unk> , &quot; what happens if we put a <unk> surface of our country , what if we just put them in a message , they usually have to go to canada or america ? &quot;
in the summer of 2009 , there was a <unk> <unk> .
in the next few elections , <unk> <unk> won <unk> in a <unk> whose program both design and <unk> .
he invited <unk> to become his <unk> .
in the meantime , i was looking at a talk at tedglobal .
through improvement , trial and through the study of aid , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of <unk> city .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine you &apos;re not allowed to be <unk> .
we use new technologies , but for progress , it requires technologies and laws , and it &apos;s usually laws for us .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of <unk> <unk> the link to the tedtalk .
again , he showed him .
the two called me .
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s present this to the top of our country ! &quot;
so we met in december of the <unk> of a hotel in miami .
i tried to make sure how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost .
and i used this chart to show how valuable <unk> is in a place like new york , think that a surface in some cases per square meter of dollars is worth .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , in a place when there was a pause , <unk> said , &quot; paul , we might maybe look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so , in a very simple form , in a very simple form , that a <unk> city is a place whose beginning is a place called <unk> , a <unk> , which is the laws of law , which is available there , and the ability to decide either under these rules or not .
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of <unk> , who meant that we have to make this project that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way we get our country .
i was asked to come to <unk> and wake up on the fourth and 21 january of january .
so , i gave another talk with facts <unk> , who has a graph like this , trying to prove that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city , and it shows the new airport that was built in kenya .
each of them has a surface of 100 <unk> .
so i tried to convince the <unk> of it if you want to build a new city , you have to start with an area of at least 1,000 <unk> .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
they all have <unk> .
the faces of the audience were very serious .
the head of congress came up on stage and said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you very much for the talk , but maybe we might look at the tedtalk .
i have him on my laptop here . &quot;
so i sat down , and they &apos;ve taken the tedtalk .
and i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that a new city will offer people new possibilities .
there would be an opportunity to live in a city that would be trapped , instead of hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city includes new opportunities for leaders .
the leaders of government would have been based on the aid of <unk> , they could benefit from their <unk> , they could support the laws that would support the laws for this charter , and they would support that everybody can trust that the charter is really being <unk> .
and the realization of president <unk> , was that the <unk> of <unk> i was thinking about , as a way to get the foreign investors to build this city , to build that city for all the parties that have been under fear for many years .
we are in an area .
this picture is from this place .
it <unk> a thousand thousand miles .
and shortly after that , on the 19th 19th of january , they decided to have a change in the constitution for a change that was special for special <unk> .
in a country which has just been out of a crisis , was given to congress for these <unk> with <unk> .
all parties , all the <unk> of society , <unk> this .
to be part of the constitution , it must be twice by congress .
on 17th 17th , it became the second time with cyrus to a voice .
immediately after that choice , between the 21st and the journal of february , a collection of about 30 miles to the two places in the world most interested were interested in the business of the <unk> .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a large , new city , which was built in south korea as the city of <unk> .
everything you can see in this picture was taken within four years after it took four years to get the <unk> .
the other place that was really interested in most is singapore .
there have been two cities in china and the third one is in preparation .
so if you basically think about it , that &apos;s where we are today .
they already have a <unk> ; and they already have this area for the second city .
it &apos;s already working on a legal system that <unk> allows you to do it , and it &apos;s working on a natural system .
a country already has permission to put its top advantage as a dish for the <unk> <unk> of the building system .
<unk> and <unk> are very interested .
even funding with one .
one thing you already know has been <unk> , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
there are a lot of companies that would like to be in america , especially in a place with <unk> , and there are a lot of people who would like to live there .
all over the world , 700 million people say they want to live in a different place .
a million people left every year and go to the united states .
many of you are fathers who are forced to pursue their families to do work , sometimes they &apos;re young mothers who have to earn enough money to eat and clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes sometimes kids are trying to find their parents , which , in some cases , have never seen a decade .
so what is it for an idea to think about how to build a whole new city ?
or even <unk> of these cities , or hundreds of all around the world ?
so what is it for an idea to make sure that every family has a choice between a number of cities that are in competition for new residents ?
that &apos;s an idea to spread .
my friends have asked me to say , thank you ted .
do you know how many decisions you do on a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i recently made a survey with over 2,000 americans recently , and the average number of decisions , which is a typical americans on a day is 70 .
in fact , in fact , a study was done in recently a study where they looked for a week .
and these scientists just have the various topics that these equations are doing , and how much time they deal with decisions with the issues .
and what they found is that a average bear was busy in the week with <unk> tasks .
each of these themes was , of course , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were hit within nine minutes or less .
except for about 12 percent of their decisions needed an hour or more of their time .
think about your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you spend in the nine minutes in the nine minutes ?
how well do you think they &apos;re doing decisions ?
today i &apos;d like to talk about one of the greatest <unk> of our modern time , the <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise me , because i &apos;m blind , just the hand , if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is , well , my first question for today is : are you willing to hear about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was a <unk> at stanford university , i went very <unk> , at least at the time .
it was a store called <unk> &apos;s .
this business , it was almost like a <unk> .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables , and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and this was at a time when we actually started <unk> .
i loved going to this business , but at one point i asked myself , well , how did you never get anything ?
here &apos;s the oil gang .
they had over 75 different kinds of oil , including the ones who were locked in boxes , who came from a thousand years old .
so i decided to go to visit one day , and i asked the head , &quot; does this model that you really offer all of these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up the <unk> of frogs that came every day and usually had their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose <unk> for our experiment .
here &apos;s her <unk> gang .
they had <unk> different kinds of <unk> .
we put a little <unk> right on the edge of the <unk> .
we have six different copies of <unk> , or 24 different <unk> , and we looked at two things : one , i guess , what would people stand standing and <unk> ?
there are more people left when they were 24 , about 60 percent when they were six , about 40 percent .
and then after that , we looked at what people were more like a glass of <unk> .
now we saw the higgs effect .
the people who are stayed than it were 24 , only three percent actually bought glass .
of the people who are still six , now we saw that 30 percent of you actually bought a glass of <unk> .
now , if you calculate it , people bought six times more than a glass , who they had six to choice when they had 24 .
now not to decide that glass is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our <unk> -- but it turns out that , in fact , it affects us with very <unk> decisions .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even though it comes to our own best interests .
so the theme of the day : saving save .
so i &apos;m going to describe to you a study that i &apos;m going to describe with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where we make the decisions for the <unk> of nearly a million americans from around the united states .
and what we looked at was whether the number of <unk> that were possible to be a <unk> , the <unk> plan that affects the probability of tomorrow .
and we found that indeed there was a context .
so in these plans , we had about <unk> data that gave people anything between two to three different users .
and what we found was that the more rituals were offered , that , in fact , disaster was lower .
now , if you look at the extreme numbers , the plans , the two <unk> , had a <unk> in the 1970s -- still not as high as we want it .
in the plans , the almost 60 fund , the <unk> went down to about <unk> <unk> .
now it turns out that even if there &apos;s more opportunities for choice , if there are more possibilities , it negative negative consequences .
so the people who decided to come up with decided that the more possibilities they have available to them , the more they <unk> it and <unk> .
the more opportunities we had available to them , the more they would put their money in love .
none of these extreme decisions , belongs to the decisions that people would recommend if we care about their future well-being .
well , over the last 10 years , we have seen three fundamental negative consequences that offer more and more choices .
they make the decision -- push them up , even if they are against their own best interest .
they &apos;re more likely to make more productive decisions -- money financial and vulnerable medical decisions .
you &apos;re more interested in things that you make yourself less happy , even if you do better .
the main thing for this is that maybe we may be able to look at these huge <unk> full of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , but we can &apos;t actually choose the contrast and we can actually choose something out of the fantastic supply .
so what i want to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in various ways and in different ways -- that you can just apply in your business .
first of all .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true than today .
people are always worried when i say , &quot; seti . &quot;
they always worry about being lost .
but in fact , we see it more and more and more , that if you &apos;re willing to move , and you will get rid of the <unk> possibilities , well , then there &apos;s a increase in sales , and it &apos;s going to cost the cost , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s a improvement of <unk> .
as a <unk> and <unk> , the various people and <unk> species of 26 to 15 meters , they reduce a increase in charge by 10 percent .
when the golden <unk> gave her 10 to the worst sold <unk> , they found that the price of profits is <unk> -- a result of two , the rise of the growth and the decline of cost .
you know , the average <unk> today offers you more products .
a typical driver offers you 100,000 products today .
but the <unk> supermarket , which is the <unk> supermarket in the world today , and they only offer you <unk> products -- kind of <unk> .
now in the world of <unk> , i think one of the best examples that recently came out of the market is how to best have the choice , was something that david <unk> has been very strong , it &apos;s a program that is offered at harvard .
every single harvard staff takes now to a <unk> part .
those who want to make a choice are 20 pounds , not 300 or more .
you know , people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to do it .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how different the possibilities are different from each other .
and if their employees can &apos;t <unk> them , they can &apos;t . &quot;
now , before we started today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he was willing to offer all the people in this audience to the beautiful street in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i &apos;d like to read you .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read them , and then i ask you to clap , if you &apos;re willing to choose gary &apos;s .
okay . everybody who &apos;s ready to choose gary &apos;s effort .
is that all ?
all right , let me show you a little bit more of it .
you knew it was a trick , right ?
now , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i may have heard more hands .
all right .
the fact is that the first time you had more information , the first time it had more information than the second time , but i would guess what to do it for the second time .
because the images made it sense to them .
which brings me to the second technology that helps you to deal with the problem , it &apos;s the <unk> .
it &apos;s about understanding people in order to understand the difference between opportunities , to understand what consequences with the individual choices and that consequences need to be felt .
why don &apos;t people give average 15 to 30 percent more if you use a <unk> or a pill , than <unk> ?
because we don &apos;t feel good money .
and it turns out , if you make it , it feels a very good tool , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people more .
so , in a study that i did with <unk> <unk> and <unk> , we &apos;ve done a study that was done with people at <unk> -- employees who worked for <unk> -- and these people were all in a row where they took their participation for their <unk> .
and during that period , we had this conference just as close as it was always , we just have a little bit of <unk> .
the small thing we &apos;ve been asked to do was we asked people to just think of all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they save money .
in which we did this simple thing , there was a increase in debt by 20 percent , and there was a increase in the number of people who were willing to save , or a increase by four percent of the amount of money they were willing to pay for the <unk> .
third technology : <unk> .
we can deal with more categories than with more choices .
here &apos;s for example , a study that we did in a <unk> .
it turns out that in the <unk> regions at the top , and down there are the number of <unk> different types of <unk> to <unk> .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines , and you put them in 10 categories , or i &apos;m going to show you 400 songs , and these are in 20 categories , then you believe that i gave you more choice and a better opportunity than i gave you the 400 given to what if i gave you the 600 600 .
because the categories tell me how to keep it apart .
here are two different <unk> .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think the left display is an ad , and the display on the right is jazz , then you put it in your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is <unk> , please clap .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is a <unk> <unk> .
the categories have to say something called the <unk> , not the choice of choice .
and this problem , you often see , if you look at the long points of all of these engines .
who do you actually want to argue with it ?
my fourth technique : for complexity .
it turns out , in fact , in more information , we can deal with more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we need to increase complexity slowly .
let me show you one example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : make a car .
here &apos;s a german <unk> that gives you an opportunity to <unk> your car itself .
you have to make different decisions to design your car completely .
now these decisions are in the number of choices they offer per decision .
<unk> , <unk> of the car -- i have advanced opportunities .
motors , <unk> -- four possibilities .
what i do now is i change the order of decisions .
half of the customers is going to be driven by the many possibilities , according to the low possibilities , four units .
the other half of the customers goes from the very small possibilities , four levels of <unk> , many possibilities .
what am i looking at ?
how interested they are .
if you keep using the power of choice , that means they &apos;re going to be <unk> , the <unk> , i hate them .
what they find is that the people who go from many to the low <unk> are over and over again .
we lose them .
go from little choices to the many , and then they stay .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the order of this information .
when i start with the simple , i study how i am .
even though the <unk> choose , i don &apos;t know anything about my characters at the <unk> , it still seems to me .
it also made me feel too much about the big product that i feel , and so i &apos;m willing to be involved with interest in this .
let me turn on .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that <unk> the problem of <unk> -- <unk> -- are you going to get rid of the <unk> alternatives ; <unk> -- make it real ; dna -- we can do better with more categories , less possibilities , based on complexity .
each of these techniques that i think today is trying to help you create the possibilities -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for the people that they offer service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re stupid .
and the more we choose the marketing , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> at youtube . i watch <unk> .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos are going to be <unk> , and then , why this is important .
we all want to be <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- when i was young , it seemed so powerful .
but <unk> have enabled that all of us or all of our creative activities will be famous in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous by the internet .
but youtube is more than 48 hours a minute .
again , just a tiny percentage ever <unk> , and then thousands of times looked at the cultural moment .
so how does this work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
well , let &apos;s go .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year , <unk> <unk> <unk> this video he had shot before his house in the <unk> national park .
2010 , it was taken 23 million times .
this chart shows what it looked like when the video last summer was popular for the first time .
actually , don &apos;t want to make a <unk> video .
he just wanted to share a <unk> .
because you do it like this , if you &apos;re called <unk> mountain .
he had a lot of <unk> .
and this video was actually already sent in january .
what happened here ?
there was jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> <unk> the reader who made the video so popular .
because <unk> like jimmy <unk> challenges us new and interesting things and show them a big audience .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> &apos;s <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> on the <unk> . she didn &apos;t think we were going to lead those conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
rs <unk> is one of the great videos of the year .
this year , almost 200 million times .
this is what the chart looked like .
it seems like &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; seems to be out of nowhere .
what happened that day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know it , these other <unk> are also <unk> .
but what about that day , that particular friday ?
well , <unk> <unk> it up , many blogs started writing about it .
michael michael nelson by <unk> science theater was a first guy who made a joke at twitter .
what &apos;s important is that a person or a group of <unk> is a standpoint of <unk> , with a big audience and a big audience .
and then there &apos;s this community of people who shared this big <unk> and starting to talk about it and talk about it .
now there are 10,000 <unk> of <unk> at youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a cure for each individual <unk> .
unlike the <unk> conversation of the 20th century , our way of being part of this phenomenon -- either by making it spread or something new .
<unk> <unk> is animation and music in <unk> .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s like .
this year , it became almost 50 million times .
and if you think this is crazy , you &apos;ll know that there &apos;s a <unk> , which is four million times .
even cats are looking at this video .
cats are looking at cats looking at this video .
what matters is , creativity , which is in the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
there was <unk> .
somebody made an enormous version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole <unk> <unk> out of the ground that made it joke to something that we can all participate in .
today , we don &apos;t just find pleasure in something we &apos;re doing .
who could have done it all ?
who could have been &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; or <unk> black or &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
what <unk> do you write your writing in which something like that ?
in a world where every minute two days , it can only really be unique and <unk> like the <unk> videos .
i &apos;m not really interested in being a friend , when a friend told me i &apos;d look at this great video , about a guy who was in new york for britain .
i got a ticket because i wasn &apos;t on the <unk> , but there &apos;s a lot of things that don &apos;t let you drive on the car .
it was completely surprising , and it was a <unk> <unk> idea and his argument five million times .
this approach is true of everything we creative .
and this all leads to one big question ...
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , completely unexpected , are the features of a new kind of media and culture that everyone has access to the audience .
as i said , one of the most biggest stars in the world -- justin &apos;s spring -- did his start at youtube .
nobody has to give your ideas green light .
and today , we all feel as a creator of our culture .
and these aren &apos;t the characteristics of the old media , and they hardly meet the media today , but they will determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk to about three minutes between women talking about three generations , and , like the amazing strength of this thing , in a single girl &apos;s life , when she was talking about 30 years ago with her little sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights <unk> in a small boat in the chinese sea . a <unk> that lived in life this little girl in the chinese sea and never talk to them ?
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that is still <unk> .
i want to tell you some of the <unk> .
imagine the first piece : a man who <unk> his life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole lives of the simple hope of unity and freedom of his home .
if you think of it as the <unk> in <unk> in front of your eyes , as it turns out that his life was a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , <unk> now his friends .
he moved to silence .
he died , broken through history .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never forget me his life .
i had to worry that it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job to learn that history was trying to <unk> us , we did it .
next <unk> shows you just like a boat in the early <unk> beach on lake <unk> .
my mother may be 18 , when her father died -- already in a <unk> marriage , with two little girls .
for her , life had asked her a task : the presence of her family and a new life in australia .
it was completely clear that she could fail .
after a <unk> and <unk> <unk> , a boat drop on the sea as a <unk> .
all adults were aware of risks .
the biggest fear they had in front of us , rape and death .
like most adults , my mother wore a little <unk> .
when i was a <unk> , my sister and i , then she and my grandmother were <unk> .
my first memories are from this boat -- the <unk> <unk> of the engine , leaving one of every wave on the back , the smallest and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the <unk> that many times came from , but from the <unk> of men on our boat , or on the <unk> of the engine , the six hours not wanted to start .
but i remember the lights on the front coast of the coast coast , and the young man who died and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first <unk> to me was one of the men on the platform .
no apple ever did that .
after three months in an hour , we landed in thailand .
and the next <unk> is about four women in three generations that build together a new life .
we let us go back to <unk> , one by the <unk> <unk> , whose population is made of <unk> .
unlike the <unk> , whose existence was totally unknown to me , there was no <unk> .
it comes from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> were broken between people who had a thing in common : they started new .
my mother worked on atlanta , then on a <unk> , six days , twice layers .
you kind of managed to find the time , english and <unk> .
we were poor .
every dollar has been beaten and became more training in more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we needed to do for it , and mostly the new stuff that came out of the second hand .
two few <unk> for school , every one of the holes in the other .
a <unk> to <unk> , because she had to be six years .
and there were the rare <unk> of &quot; <unk> , &quot; and here &apos;s <unk> : &quot; <unk> , go home . &quot;
home ?
something <unk> .
there was a meeting , and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to get out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i played in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we were telling each other from our day , and we heard the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother was suffering from the boat .
and it was my job , every night , until her <unk> came , so i could wake her .
she <unk> a <unk> , then a <unk> , a <unk> .
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t care about change , angry and <unk> , and <unk> children between two worlds .
<unk> and <unk> were <unk> .
centers were built .
i lived in <unk> .
in one of the years , i was the classic classic student who turned <unk> on himself .
in the other , i was in <unk> life , the tragic <unk> of violence , the <unk> and the <unk> .
but so many <unk> over the years .
and because of that help , i was <unk> as young <unk> of the year .
and i was taken from a <unk> to the next bit , and the maldives didn &apos;t fit together .
<unk> le , <unk> <unk> of <unk> , was now a <unk> , refugee and social activist who had never heard of places that she had never heard of , and in stockholm whose existence had never imagined it .
i was <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to use it .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to the <unk> and the <unk> of the life of an unknown <unk> -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who lived each of their days as long as they were telling each other the stories of their day and <unk> , and we &apos;re still in the same bed .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was as old when we went on the boat .
no , no way .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you are . &quot;
so i talked about <unk> and training , and the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
and the more i talked , the more i should tell .
i met people in all <unk> , so many of them did what they loved in the boundaries of the possible .
and even though i had my degree , i realized that i could not go with a career in art .
there had to be another <unk> .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a <unk> , a <unk> , new image -- not just okay , but something you &apos;ve got to be grateful , maybe a gift &apos;s gift .
because <unk> can lead to collapse so easily , so light can mean you accepted the assumptions of the environment .
now , i went enough from my <unk> to know that , yes , the world is <unk> , but not the way you <unk> it .
possibilities that were not allowed to have been <unk> .
there was a energy , a <unk> optimism , a strange <unk> of humility and <unk> .
so i went to my gut .
i collected a little team of people around me , for the <unk> , not a <unk> challenge .
we didn &apos;t have a cents for a year .
and at the end of a day , i had a huge dense soup that we shared .
we went to night late .
most of our ideas were crazy , but they were a few brilliant in it , and we managed to get the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull into the u.s .
after just a journey there .
my gut again .
three months later , i was moved , and the adventure went on .
before i leave the talk , i &apos;d like to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time when the social norm and the local was the most important person .
life hasn &apos;t changed since centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mother moved her alone .
with 17 , she was the second woman of a woman whose mother called her .
without support of her husband , she gave her a <unk> by having brought him in court and <unk> in her own case , and a bigger <unk> than she won .
&quot; won &apos;t be lost as <unk> .
i was in a hotel hotel in sydney , when she died . 1,000 miles away .
i looked through the <unk> , and i saw them on the other side .
i knew she got there to go .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went to a <unk> temple in <unk> and sat around her shop .
we told her stories , and she told her that we were still with her .
and then he came in , and he said he had to close .
my mother asked us to beat her hand .
she said , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because she since this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; they didn &apos;t break them . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s all the women .
and you can see who we were and how life has created us , we can now see that the men who have come to our lives would have come to us in the <unk> .
would be too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i still think of the boat .
who would ever want one ?
yeah , i &apos;m scared of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
can i give you a ph.d. in your life , the infinite of every wave , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the engine , which does nothing ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this and make it safe , i would do it .
also , <unk> mother is here today in the fourth or fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it possible at all ?
because this is a picture you can &apos;t take with your camera .
still , my interest in photography when i received my first digital digital age at age 15 .
i was looking at it with my former <unk> for drawing , but it was a little different , because , using the camera , the process was really in planning .
and if you put a picture of it with a camera , the process ends up when you put on the track .
so to me , it seemed to be about going on the right place at the right time .
i believed everybody could do that .
so i wanted to create something else , something that begins with the process when it &apos;s being produced .
photos like this : a turn along a much <unk> road .
but it has an unexpected rate .
and yet , a realistic level .
or photos like this -- dark and <unk> at the same time , but everyone with the common goal of trying to keep a realistic level .
when i say reality , i mean <unk> .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can really do , but i always want to look like you could have it on a photo .
photographs that you have to think a brief moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more like one idea , really , really a moment .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
is it about the details or color ?
is it about light ?
what is the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be made on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not what matters , but what we think is realistic .
so i think it &apos;s very simple .
i think you as a puzzle of reality , where you can take different pieces and build together to create an alternative reality .
and let me just show you one simple example .
we have three perfect physical objects that we can all identify with in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , you can create something that looks like it could still exist .
but at the same time , we know that that &apos;s not possible .
so we &apos;re looking at our brains , because our brain doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combine of photographs .
it &apos;s really just about combine different things .
so the things that make up an image look , i think it &apos;s the things we don &apos;t think about , the things around us .
but when we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise they &apos;re kind of wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a long-term outcome .
as you can see , these aren &apos;t three special images .
but you can do something special about this .
so the first rule is that both photos should have photos the same perspective .
second , two photos should have given photographs .
and these two pictures are bringing these two <unk> -- the same height , and the same <unk> .
third , it &apos;s about making it possible to tell where the individual images begin and end by adding them together .
it &apos;s impossible to tell you what the photo was actually .
so by looking color , contrast and contrast on the edges , the individual images , <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> colors and disorders , we <unk> the boundaries between the different images and let them look like a single photograph , even though a picture basically can contain hundreds of layers of layers .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that this is just a <unk> and the bottom part of it .
but in fact , this picture is completely completely different from photographs of different places .
personally , i personally argue that it &apos;s easier to create a place like a place , because you don &apos;t have to have to put your ideas in your head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed several months to plan them , to find them , to find the different places for the sound .
for example , the fish was taken on a <unk> .
the ocean comes from another place .
the <unk> comes from a <unk> .
and yes , i even put the house up on the island in red to make it look cute .
so to get a <unk> outcome , this is going from me on planning .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea .
after that , it &apos;s the combination of different images .
and here &apos;s every piece very well .
and if you do good pictures , it can be pretty beautiful , and it can be pretty realistic .
so it &apos;s all the tools there , and the only thing that <unk> us is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic <unk> have failed .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things that we introduced in <unk> was a <unk> .
this is not particularly scientifically -- you imagine a cup of coffee or tea back and asks the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how is it ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why all of them -- maybe most of the electronic <unk> <unk> : because we stopped listening .
this is my favorite one . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
she &apos;s got a button .
and every morning i do .
and yes , i have a task , as you may recognize .
i &apos;ve got my job at 95 pounds .
it just works : every time i get to the scale , you send my data on google health .
and they &apos;re also there by my <unk> <unk> so that he can see where my <unk> is , and not only in the moment that i need to support <unk> or so , but also with a look at the past .
there &apos;s something else .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with , i &apos;ve been on twitter .
so every morning i go on my talk , and people talk to me before i sit in the car , &quot; for lunch , only a little <unk> today , <unk> . &quot;
but this is the <unk> thing that can happen , because this is the <unk> , <unk> , to help patients , because this could be used for obesity , or it could patients the smoke .
it could also be used to get people out of their clothes and get them to play some kind of game together to make their health better .
the next week comes to market .
there will be this little <unk> that you put in your iphone or something like that .
and it will enable people to measure their blood pressure , to send it to their doctor and to share it with others , for a little more than 100 dollars .
and at this point , patients come to play . they can &apos;t only take control of their own ship on their own ship , but can also help us care about the challenges that are in front of us , and the <unk> of health care , higher demand , and so on .
make ways that are easy to use , and start paying patients in the team .
and they can do that through these methods , but also by <unk> .
and one of the things that we did , i want to share with you through a quick video .
we have all our cars in our cars .
maybe even in our phones .
we know exactly where all the <unk> are around .
we know one where all of them are .
and sure , we can find <unk> .
but where would the next <unk> to help this patient ?
we have <unk> , and nobody knew it .
no one knew where the next <unk> was found in that moment .
so , what did we do ? we did it in the netherlands .
and we asked a website and a <unk> asked , &quot; if you can see a <unk> , please share with where he is , when he &apos;s closed , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed while <unk> , of course .
and over 10,000 <unk> have been in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps .
and we &apos;ve designed a <unk> model .
we &apos;ve developed an app for <unk> , integrated reality to find these <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> , and somebody &apos;s up , you can use your iphone , and within the next few weeks you can also find to find the next <unk> who can save lives .
and yet , what we want to do today is not just as a <unk> , as the product calls , but also as <unk> .
and we want to bring that to a global level .
and we &apos;re asking our colleagues around the world , from other universities , to help us behave like <unk> , to put these <unk> around the world .
and if you &apos;re in front of you and someone else , whether it &apos;s your own posture or anyone else you can find such a <unk> .
the other thing we &apos;d like to ask is that companies around the world are helping us to help us do this <unk> .
these could be <unk> , or for example , just to make sure the <unk> is still in its place .
please help us , and try and not only improve health , but to take your hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to report from unexpected discoveries .
i work in <unk> .
and my little <unk> wants us to make a difference by doing ...
... it <unk> .
here &apos;s a short video of what we do .
oh . a moment .
it might take it until it &apos;s <unk> .
now , we can just cut it up -- i &apos;m just going to throw the video ...
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a couple of years ago , i started a program to take the stars in technology and design , to work for a year and work in a environment that is pretty much what they actually hate , and we put them in government .
the program is called the code for america , and it &apos;s a little bit like the <unk> for <unk> .
we pick out some <unk> every year , and we let them work with <unk> .
instead of sending them to the third world , we send them in <unk> .
and they developed great apps , working with urban employees .
but what they really do is show you what technology is possible today .
so , meet al .
al is a <unk> in the city boston .
this looks like he &apos;s looking for a penguin , but what he really looks like is somebody who <unk> him when he &apos;s <unk> because he knows he &apos;s not very good at <unk> when it &apos;s from a meter snow .
how did he come looking for help in this particular way ?
we had a team last year in boston with the code for america .
they were there in february , and it happened last february a lot .
and they realized that the city never <unk> this fire .
but a particular fellow , a man named ben <unk> , he noticed something else , and that was that the residents were free , right in front of these parts .
so he did what everybody would do , he wrote a app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can download a fire .
you <unk> it for free when it <unk> .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , you can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little <unk> .
this is a <unk> little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of 21 apps that the last year written .
but she does something that no other <unk> does .
it &apos;s <unk> .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> hall of the city of <unk> , who saw that he could use this app , not in snow , but in order for citizens to <unk> citizens .
it &apos;s very important that these <unk> work , but people steal batteries .
so he got the citizens to check it .
and then obama decided to use the app to get citizens to get citizens .
and chicago has just introduced it to people when it <unk> .
we now know nine cities that plan to use this app .
and she &apos;s spread , organic , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you know , it usually doesn &apos;t work .
the <unk> of software takes a few years .
we had a team who worked on a project last year in boston for three people two and a half months .
it was a way of working with parents that are the right public schools for their children .
we told us later that , if it would go over the normal , it would have taken over two years , and it would have been over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing at all .
there is currently a project that has spent two billion dollars now , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
so , an app which is written in a few days , and then from <unk> , a kind of <unk> is a kind of <unk> to the institution of government .
it shows how government could work better -- no longer a private company , how many people think it should be .
and not even like a <unk> , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , it &apos;s a new generation that represents the problem of government -- not as the problem of a <unk> institution , but as a problem of collective growth .
and that &apos;s a very good news because it turns out that we are very good at collective technology .
now there &apos;s a large community of people who make the tools we need to effectively do things effectively .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , &quot; there are hundreds of people all over the country who are writing up and writing every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up government .
they &apos;re frustrated frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t worry about it ; they fix it .
and these people know what we lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you all feelings your feelings about politics and the line and all the other things that we really know about , is government , in the core , in the words of tim o <unk> , &quot; which we do in common we cannot do alone . &quot;
today , a lot of people support government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i want you to think about it because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is changing .
and because the government finally came out of us -- <unk> you , &quot; we people ? &quot; -- how we think about how this change happens .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
and like a lot of people , i thought it was the government mainly to choose people into a office .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that most of the aid is all about aid .
this is the <unk> for service and information .
that &apos;s where you normally get out when you &apos;re in your city .
if you ever have a chance to work in your <unk> , like our fellow scott <unk> , as part of the program -- in fact , do you all -- you &apos;re going to see that the people who call government because of many different problems , including a <unk> in your house .
scott gets this <unk> .
he described &quot; <unk> &quot; into the official database .
and he didn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the <unk> .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and play a very nice music and see if that &apos;s <unk> ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but that was not the end of the <unk> .
boston , not just a client .
it has an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is work very smart in the office office in boston .
one day -- this is a <unk> report -- came in this : &quot; <unk> in my <unk> . can &apos;t tell if she &apos;s dead .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what happened to us is different .
scott is different from man .
but it &apos;s all public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next one that we got was , &quot; i went there , found the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yes . alive ? <unk> .
she turned to the site . went home .
good night , cute <unk> . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . this is the digital one .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is getting into this .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m going to talk more about a platform for people to help and help others .
citizens helped another citizens , but the government played a central role here .
they did these two people .
and you could allow them to be able to connect them with government , if they were needed , but a neighbor is far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
when one neighbor helps the other , we connect our communities .
let &apos;s call it the <unk> , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we have to think that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they believe that one is the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is the vote .
how many times we chose a political leader -- and sometimes we use a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we &apos;ll go back and expect that the government , our values and our needs , and then hasn &apos;t changed much ?
this is because the government is like a further ocean , and politics is the top <unk> .
and what &apos;s below is what we call iraq .
and we use this word with these <unk> .
but it &apos;s this obsession that we have this thing that we own , and for which we pay , we can pay for us , something else , and then we <unk> ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we need to be sexy .
because this is where the actual <unk> is happening .
we need to address government .
so the <unk> did it .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of brilliant citizens who wrote a very famous report that has written an answer to <unk> .
this is not politically active , which is active active .
now , for those of us who chose government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world we want to leave our children .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to ask .
do we really believe that we can reach what we need to do without improving a institution in the name of all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible to create the function of the government fundamentally in a way that actually can achieve society by protecting society .
and there &apos;s a generation called the <unk> internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you have to only build the right systems .
now the average age of our food is 28 , so i am , unfortunately , a generation older than most of you .
this is a generation which grew up to see her voice as granted .
they &apos;re not fighting this fight that we &apos;re all fighting to talk about who can talk ; they &apos;re all allowed to talk .
you can tell your mind , every channel at every time , and you do it .
so , if you deal with the problem of government , you don &apos;t care about being able to use your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the work of government .
and these tools let us use our hands to improve communities .
this could be a fire , <unk> , <unk> , a drive with a <unk> .
and sure , we would have <unk> these <unk> all the time , and a lot of people do it .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we are not only consumers , and we are not just consumers of government to pay taxes and benefits .
we are more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government until we improve our minds .
so the question i all have for you here : when it comes to the big , important things we have to do together , all together will we have a lot of voices , or are we going to be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
normally , my role is to explain to people what wonderful are the new technologies that are the most common , and i thought , because i &apos;m under friends , i would tell you what i really think is , and also trying to look back and understand what &apos;s really going on with these incredible <unk> forward , which is so quickly happening that we can hardly reach .
i &apos;m going to start by showing you a single <unk> slide .
... could you just show the slide .
this is a slide that i came out from my name .
i &apos;m not talking about the details of the slide , but rather than the most powerful form .
this slide shows an analysis of an analysis from us about the performance of <unk> <unk> compared to the power of a <unk> device .
what &apos;s interesting here is that this slide , like so many others that we often see in our field , is sort of at a <unk> curve .
in other words , every step here is one of the power in <unk> .
and this is a <unk> that we have to use this guy on <unk> curves in the field of technology .
something very exciting happens here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about .
so if you put the light back again .
another thing about it , because i &apos;m going to draw something on paper here .
now why do we draw evidence in technology at <unk> curves ?
and the reason for this is , if i draw it on a normal curve , where , say , this is the number of years , which is the same kind of technology , and this is a fundamental trend of technology that i want to do with a graph , then the graph will be silly .
they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to take another technology , let &apos;s say , let &apos;s say , this is a very <unk> scale on the <unk> scale , in the form of a flat line .
but if something like this happens here , this changes the <unk> circumstances .
so if the <unk> were going to be as fast as the <unk> would be , then we could go into an asteroid and we would be in tokyo seconds .
but it &apos;s not that fast .
we &apos;ve never had this before in the history of <unk> , this kind of <unk> growth , which took all the few years exponentially exponentially .
so the question i want to ask you now is , if you look at these exponential curves , you don &apos;t always see them forever .
it &apos;s not possible that it &apos;s all forever and forever as fast as now .
there are two possibilities .
either it becomes a classic <unk> like this , until something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
it &apos;s something like that .
now , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this will happen .
it really means that we &apos;re in the middle of the middle of a transition here right now .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the world , to a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask , and i often ask myself , is how this new world will be probably ?
what is this new state that makes the world slow ?
because the transition seems to seem very , very vulnerable when you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , the future was somewhere in 2000 , and people often talked about what would happen in 2000 .
now here &apos;s a conference where people talk about the future , and you realize the future is still in 2000 .
further than that , we don &apos;t .
so in other words , the future every year since i &apos;m in the world .
i think the reason for this is that we realize anything is wrong .
the transition is happening . we can feel it all .
and we know that right now , there &apos;s just no sense of trying to look 30 or 50 years into the future , because everything is going to be so different that a simple <unk> of what we &apos;re doing right now doesn &apos;t make sense .
now i want to talk about this transition in which we are right now .
so to do that first , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really don &apos;t have to do with technology or computers .
because i think in order to really understand this , we have to take a step back and look at this thing at a time .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at at the level of life on earth .
i think the most interesting thing makes sense when you put it into a few <unk> .
so let &apos;s go back , and for a half billion years , the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> with lots of <unk> chemicals .
now , if you think of the way these chemicals were organized , that &apos;s a pretty good picture about how you got it .
i think there are theories that begin to understand how everything started with computing , but i &apos;m going to tell you a story about which is that at that time , little <unk> <unk> , which are different kinds of <unk> for chemicals .
now , some of these <unk> forces are a special combination of chemicals that allow them to integrate other chemicals from the following and so on .
everybody who were the way they started .
these little <unk> were in sense the <unk> <unk> .
but it wasn &apos;t something like living in today &apos;s senses , because every single one of them was just a little , <unk> recipe of chemicals .
and every time it turned out , the inside of <unk> chemicals have been distributed .
so each other was a little different .
in fact , the <unk> , which one of the growth of the growth of the growth faster than others and growing more and more chemicals faster .
so these things tend to survive longer , and they <unk> in <unk> .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting , when these <unk> have learned a trick .
in some ways , a way that we don &apos;t quite understand yet , this is the ability to understand information .
they learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , and in a certain chemical shape that we call dna .
in the other words , they have found a way to find a way that allowed them to <unk> <unk> , so that this information could be taken and copied .
the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information is over the time of 2.5 billion years when it came out , right .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , from exactly the same code and the same <unk> .
and each creatures uses exactly the same letters and the same code .
we &apos;re here to be able to write ourselves in this code .
and i have here 100 <unk> of a white <unk> , which i try to keep in liquid miles from <unk> .
and this is what i did , and what i did is i took this code -- the code consists of normal letters that we use to <unk> -- and i put my <unk> on a piece of dna , and i wrote it 10 times 22 times .
so if somebody wants to <unk> a hundred million copies of my life , i have enough for anyone in this room and even for everyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i &apos;d been a <unk> , i would have written you on a virus and put it in the room .
so what &apos;s next step ?
the dna of dna was a interesting step .
and these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another , very interesting step , where things were completely different , and that is to communicate these cells and interact information , so that communities came from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew it , but bacteria can actually share their dna .
and that &apos;s why , for example , the expansion grows to antibiotics .
some bacteria have figured out how they can grow from australia and have these information together with other bacteria into the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria which are resistant to chemicals , because the bacteria communicate each other .
now , these communication are now making communities that were in some sense in the same boat ; they were <unk> .
so they either survive together , or they went together , and that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals in the community became more frequently and different from evolution .
now , the <unk> is where these communities are so close to the fact that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community into the dna .
and the next interesting stage took about another billion years .
at this point , we have <unk> communities , communities of many <unk> <unk> , which combined as individual organism .
indeed , we &apos;re also a <unk> community .
we have a lot of cells that are no longer being asked alone .
your skin cells are <unk> without heart cells , muscle , pollution and so on .
so these communities started developing , so that the level of which evolution was happening was no longer the single cell , but the whole thing we call organism .
now the next step is within these communities .
the <unk> started <unk> information .
and they developed special structures that made nothing different than information within organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the <unk> that have built these <unk> .
they started working on specialists in the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding , and repair information .
and this was the brain , and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave you an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point , individual -- learning happened within the period of human organism , rather than thinking about this evolutionary period .
so a organism was able to learn , for example , to eat a certain <unk> , because she was bad and sick , the last time he ate it .
now , within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas before hundreds of thousands of years had been needed , because that information had to be learned by the individuals that died because of these disorders , because these <unk> were not there yet .
so the nervous system has been able to do with these special <unk> , because evolution could now take place within an individual .
it could take place within a time .
what happened then is that individual organisms found a way to communicate each other .
once for example , the <unk> version of this <unk> is human language .
but it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , <unk> idea in my head .
and i &apos;m sitting here , basically , <unk> sounds of me , hoping that i could create a similar idea in your head that has some sort of odd idea to my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , put it in sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to work again as a <unk> organism .
and what we actually did , we started to research .
we &apos;ve got the same steps , which have gone through <unk> -- the <unk> of our methods of how we touch data , present .
the invention of language was a small step in that direction .
<unk> , computers , <unk> , <unk> and so on are all our <unk> mechanisms that we &apos;ve built in our community to <unk> this information .
and it connects all of us together to something that is much bigger , and also capable of developing faster than we &apos;ve been .
so today , evolution can happen in time period .
you &apos;ve also seen <unk> little <unk> where he showed a little evolution in the <unk> program , right in front of your eyes .
so now we have the <unk> again .
the first steps of history i told you about a billion years ago .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , a few hundred million years .
then the <unk> steps , like language and so on , are less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to seem very few decades .
the process is moving itself , and it &apos;s going to , i think , is the word for that -- if something is more powerful .
the more it changes , the faster changes it .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this <unk> curve .
we see the process that <unk> itself .
i live from the building of computers , and i know that i can build the mechanism that i use to build computers , not using the recently that we &apos;ve done without the recent research advances .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible to design this in traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single person in the <unk> does .
it has billions of them .
what i &apos;m doing instead of doing , and what &apos;s going to work on the designers of thinking , is that we think of a certain <unk> , the machine , and the machine does something out of it , which is better and better than we could ever do it ourselves .
and it makes it partly with methods that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
one method which is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve used a lot recently is evolution itself .
and we put a <unk> in the machine , which is in the <unk> .
so to give you an example , in the most extreme cases , we can make a program that &apos;s developed from random fuels .
we say , &quot; computers , <unk> , a hundred million random <unk> sequences .
now , all of you , i want to take all of these random <unk> out , all the programs , and pay attention to those who are the next one . &quot;
so in other words , i guess first what i want .
let &apos;s say i want to give numbers , this would be a simple example i used for it .
so , you find programs that can <unk> the number of numbers .
of course , the chance at random is so small that it &apos;s very small by chance by chance , so i don &apos;t think they &apos;re going to do this .
but one of which likes to do with happiness two numbers in the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , now are going to take those 10 percent of the sequences that i &apos;ve come to the next one .
<unk> this off , <unk> the rest .
now all the <unk> that the numbers have best at the best .
and in fact , with a method of <unk> , <unk> to finance . &quot;
take two programs , and they produce children through the exchange of their <unk> , and the children <unk> the characteristics of <unk> from the two programs .
so now i have a new generation of programs that came from using programs that have come closer to the point than others .
tell me this process . &quot;
<unk> it again .
maybe some mutations .
and try that again with another generation .
all these generations need just a few minutes .
and so i can run a evolution over millions of years in the computer , or in some cases , a few hours .
finally , i get programs that can break numbers of numbers .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i &apos;d ever write by hand .
when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s <unk> and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know and i &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to do that job because you &apos;re from a series of <unk> programs that did job .
because their life depends on whether they did the job .
so , i was once in a meeting , and i sat in a row , and he <unk> a map and says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
it says , &quot; this plane is made out of <unk> <unk> that work together to make their flight safer . &apos; don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
we know that a <unk> isn &apos;t <unk> .
so , we &apos;re starting to rely on computers , for a process which is very different from the classical system .
it allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than it would allow the normal methods to produce .
and yet we don &apos;t really understand the possibility of it yet .
so , <unk> <unk> us .
we use these programs now to make the computers a lot faster , so that we can make that processes even faster .
so there &apos;s a <unk> .
it &apos;s getting faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so vulnerable .
because all of these new technologies now feed themselves .
we raise off .
we &apos;re at a point , which is why , at the time , when <unk> evolved to <unk> .
so we are the <unk> , and we can &apos;t quite see what the hell here are .
we &apos;re in the middle of this <unk> .
but i really believe that after all .
i find it very different from us to say we are the <unk> of evolution .
and i think we &apos;re all part of the creation of what &apos;s going on next .
now , the lunch is before , and i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll hear here now before i &apos;m going .
my story begins right here in kenya , about two years ago .
i was under the <unk> desert in the desert with <unk> <unk> .
we talked about that nothing has changed since the age of ancient indian <unk> . &quot;
if we wanted to travel back at the time , we put in a car and <unk> over the sky .
now we do that with airplanes .
at the time , when the great indian <unk> had been <unk> , he took a bow and went to the soil and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with <unk> and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
that made me sad .
i got some fear of technology .
it made me fear that i could lose the ability to enjoy the boss without a camera , and without my friends .
i found that technology should make magic and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me little <unk> .
this piece became old technology for me .
she became an <unk> access to a world of <unk> and <unk> ships and led to pictures in my imagination .
i &apos;d like to think of it as though our send and cameras started dreams .
they were being inspired by this .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use them instead of killing magic .
at 16 , i started to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to storytelling that readers around the world .
it can know how we keep it .
it can know where we are .
it <unk> images and text and animation and touch and touch .
the storytelling always needed more senses .
but what do we do with that ?
i just go to <unk> , an interactive ipad app .
here says , &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here says , &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; i write my name .
and i get a character in the book .
and again , a letter falls down to me -- and the ipad knows by gps where i live -- which is right to me .
so the kid in me is really excited about these possibilities .
i talked a lot about magic .
i mean , the magic of childhood , the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
i was always exciting in a glass .
this is how you &apos;ve got to grow the ipad , and you have to <unk> .
and they put the path through the rest of the book .
another idea that struck me as a child is that a whole galaxy can put up in a single <unk> .
and so here &apos;s why every book and every world is a little <unk> that i &apos;m coming here to the magic device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
<unk> had always maps , but these cards were static .
this map is growing and <unk> and <unk> in the rest of the book .
it &apos;s also showing other places of the book .
i go in here .
it &apos;s important for me to create something that is important , but also very <unk> .
these are the <unk> .
we &apos;ve all heard about <unk> and <unk> , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the <unk> ?
the poor <unk> were caught thousands of years in <unk> , in a old <unk> book .
and we bring them back to a remarkable story for children .
a story that shows up with new issues like <unk> .
for the theme of <unk> , a big problem for the last 10 years is that children are sitting in their hands , on their computers , without selling them .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
in a interaction of the book , you &apos;re going to be sent to a search , you have to go out and connect with the camera images of natural objects .
as a child , i had <unk> <unk> , rocks , <unk> and <unk> .
somehow , kids don &apos;t do it anymore .
this is <unk> <unk> . you have to go down to make a picture of a flower .
in another chapter , you have to <unk> a piece of <unk> and tag .
so you actually create a digital collection of photographs you can then put online .
a kid in london shows the picture of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , today i saw a <unk> . &quot;
a kid in india says , &quot; today i saw a monkey . &quot;
it creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photos that you actually took .
there &apos;s a variety of ways of connecting magic to connect the world and technology .
in the next book , we plan an interaction where you use the video of the telescope , and through <unk> , a animation of <unk> that appear on a plant before the house .
in one place , the screen <unk> with leaves .
you &apos;ve got to read the sound of the car , and they read the rest of the book .
we all move in a world where the nature of technology is getting closer and in magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our kids and closer to the natural world and to the magic , fun and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor to me .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , <unk> or <unk> .
i spend most of my time with social successes in <unk> and places where there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
to be here at ted , to see and hear how meditation it is , has given me a lot of power .
so , in the short time here , i became a clear : ted has a identity .
you can say things that have changed the world .
and sometimes when something about ted comes , it gets meaning and force that otherwise wouldn &apos;t have otherwise .
i say that because i believe identity is very important .
we saw some fantastic presentations .
i believe that we have learned that words have a word meaning , but that &apos;s the words of a brilliant program particularly special .
as a doctor , you can do good . you can still do good .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a lawyer .
i learned this from my grandmother .
i was grew up in a family , a traditional <unk> household , who was <unk> by a <unk> , and that was my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , strong woman , had effect .
she had the last word in any <unk> .
she was also the beginning of many aspects in our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
their parents were born in the <unk> in virginia .
it was born in denial , and the experience of slavery were very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also <unk> .
if i met her as a little boy , she came up to me and <unk> me .
she made me realize that i could barely breathe , then let me go .
one or two hours later , when i came to her , she came up to me and said , &quot; <unk> , are you feeling my rent ? &quot;
and if i said no , she <unk> me back . if i said yes , she let me calm .
it was something that made you always wanted to be in your distance .
the only problem with this was that she had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention .
my cousins were all around .
i remember i have to have eight or nine that i went to the living room one morning , and all my cousins were walking around .
my grandmother was at the end of the room , and i remembered .
first , i thought that was a game .
i looked at her , but she looked very seriously .
this was about 15 minutes or 20 minutes , and then she stood up and came to me . she took me to the hand and said , &quot; come on , <unk> . you and me , we need to talk . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me out to the outside , and she said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise you don &apos;t know . &quot;
i said , &quot; welcome , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise me just three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; first , first of all , you &apos;re always going to love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom &apos;s my baby and you have to promise with promise that you will always take care of you . &quot;
i called my mother , so i said , &quot; yeah , ma , i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; next thing i want you to do is always do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , &quot; yeah , grandmother . i promise . &quot;
finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise to me is , &quot; you &apos;re never going to drink alcohol . &quot;
now , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise . &quot;
i grew up in the country , in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who &apos;s older and a year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this <unk> beer , and then my sister and i went to the forest .
we &apos;re just sitting there anyway .
then he took a drink beer , and he gave my sister one , and she took her , and then she grabbed me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . all right . just do you . i don &apos;t want beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do it now . this is what we do .
i had what your sister had . go , get a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want . just do you . &quot;
my brother grabbed me .
he said , &quot; what about you ? well , you know what . &quot;
then he looked at me in the face , and he said , &quot; oh no , you &apos;re still not crazy for talking about grandmother ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandmother told everybody that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was destroyed .
i &apos;m going to tell you something .
i should probably not .
this is probably going to transmit public .
i &apos;m 23 years old , and i &apos;ll never have a drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s <unk> . i say that because identity is power .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell the people around us things that they don &apos;t first believe .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would say , &quot; they &apos;re special .
my grandfather was in prison in prison .
my uncle died of <unk> diseases .
and they believed that these are the topics that we need to take care of .
i tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
there were 300,000 people in <unk> and prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today have the highest <unk> in the world today .
seven million people are on <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
i think our world fundamentally changed our world .
in social weak and black parts of the population , despair and despair , because of that change .
one out of three male black between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , on a <unk> or with <unk> <unk> .
in urban communities all over the country , from los angeles to washington , to washington to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of the black young men either in prison , in prison , on their <unk> , or with <unk> <unk> .
but our system is not just driven by questions that have <unk> to do , it &apos;s also caused by poverty .
we have a <unk> system that treated much better if they &apos;re rich and guilty as poor and innocent .
wealth , not <unk> , affects the outcome .
yet we seem to be happy with that .
a politics of fear and anger convinced us that these problems aren &apos;t our problems .
we lost the touch .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there are some <unk> developments .
my home <unk> gave you the <unk> if you &apos;re going to be arrested .
here today , in tanzania , 75 percent of the male black people are lost .
we <unk> that in 10 years , the growth of the <unk> of the world &apos;s industry is going to be as high as before the <unk> .
the silence is <unk> .
i <unk> kids .
many of my favorites are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world that <unk> children to death in prison .
in this country , for children , there are <unk> <unk> <unk> .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of technology .
the only country in the world .
i <unk> people in <unk> .
the question of death is an interesting question .
we think , because we taught it so that the real question is : did a human being made for a <unk> crime ?
it &apos;s a very primitive question .
you can also think about how we see our identity .
the other perspective isn &apos;t that anybody deserves a crime for a crime , but , did we fail to kill ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
on nine people we &apos;ve been arrested , one that we &apos;ve had for rwanda , which was <unk> and out of death .
an amazing <unk> . one of nine sons .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never run somebody with an airplane , if for nine planes , the <unk> , one .
but somehow we can get rid of this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our <unk> .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i talk about race and the question whether we &apos;re right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i teach my students a story . i talk about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , time at the end of the <unk> to the beginning of the second war .
we don &apos;t really know much about it .
but in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to fear fear .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror that changed her life .
these older people come to me now and say , &quot; ah , <unk> , you talk talks . you tell people that you should stop saying that we are going to stop it for the first time in our nation with terrorism : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell people we grew up with it . &quot;
and then of course , after terrorism came out of <unk> and decades of <unk> and decades .
and yet there is a dynamic in our country -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what meaning our actions in the historical context .
we circle all the time .
we create new dynamics and conflicts .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and <unk> .
in south africa , people understood that the <unk> is unable to be true without truth and reconciliation .
even after genocide in rwanda , there was this willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve given a few talks in germany about death .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood up to my talk , and he said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply scary to hear you . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death death in germany .
and of course , in germany , they can never give them more . &quot;
it &apos;s been completely silent . and then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we &apos;ve ever been <unk> for killing people .
it would be <unk> of us , consciously and vulnerable people . &quot;
i thought about it .
what it would feel like to live in a world where german state would have <unk> people , especially if underneath <unk> were many jews .
it would be <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , here in this country , in the united states of the old <unk> , we &apos;re going to tell people -- here &apos;s the risk of death to death , 11 times higher when the victim white is black than when it &apos;s black . 22 times higher , if the average black is black and the victim knows -- in the same states , in their soil , the bodies that the bodies have <unk> people .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental <unk> .
i think our identity is unique .
if we don &apos;t deal with these difficult issues , the positive and wonderful things also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but eventually , these great <unk> of suffering are suffering , abuse , <unk> .
i think it seems important to me both <unk> .
because what we &apos;re talking about is that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment , to be able to make a complex world .
for me , it means time to think about and talk about the poor , the <unk> , who are never going to be at ted .
but thinking in a way that is embedded in our own lives .
we all need to believe in the last thing we can &apos;t see .
we do that . that &apos;s how we &apos;re rational .
innovation , creativity , and development is not only coming from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s this <unk> , which i believe will give us , not just open to all the bright and <unk> things , but also for dark and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> politician once said .
&quot; when we were fighting in eastern europe , we wanted to do everything , but what we needed most was hope , a psychological imagination , to be sometimes in <unk> places , and be involved . &quot;
so this mental <unk> is the core of what i believe is the need to deal with it .
there &apos;s no way of technology and design that allows us to be completely human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , <unk> and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity makes a lot more of us than if we don &apos;t care about it .
it &apos;s going to touch them deeply .
as a young lawyer , i <unk> the great privilege of meeting pink parks .
and again , woman came back to <unk> , where she took two of her oldest friends , these older women , <unk> <unk> who had organized the <unk> -- an incredible <unk> -- and virginia <unk> , a white , whose husband , <unk> <unk> , dr. king <unk> .
so these women were met , they just met .
and then she <unk> and said , &quot; <unk> , woman comes into the city . we want to talk to you .
do you want to <unk> and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , very happy . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and i just stopped .
it was so inspiring , so <unk> .
and one day i was sitting there , and i heard these women , and after a couple of hours , woman turned up to me and said to me , &quot; well , <unk> , tell me what the <unk> initiative is for happiness .
what are they trying to do ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to get against injustice .
people want to help people who were convicted of innocent .
we want to fight and fight .
we want to do <unk> <unk> without <unk> <unk> for children .
we want to do something against the death penalty .
we want to reduce the number of death .
we want <unk> . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> . &quot;
she said , &quot; this will be very , very tired . &quot;
then in front of me , she put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and so they have to be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and so i believe that the ted should be <unk> .
we need to challenge ways to ask the challenges : this problems , this suffering .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
i learned some very simple things .
that we are all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every person on the planet .
when somebody is lying , it &apos;s not just an architect .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t hear it , it &apos;s not just a symptom .
even who kills somebody is not just a loser .
and because it is , there is a fundamental human dignity to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think so .
i think in many places the opposite of poverty is the opposite of poverty .
and finally , i think even though it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so we &apos;re not measured at the end of our technology , not in the things that we &apos;re developing , not in our minds and minds .
eventually , a society will not depend on how they treat their rich and powerful and elderly , but how they interact with the poor , the <unk> , the <unk> .
because in this context , we begin to understand the truly amazing things that make us .
sometimes i get balance . a story to end .
sometimes i get too much .
i &apos;m tired of how we all .
sometimes these ideas reflect our thinking in a very important way .
i had these children who were convicted of very hard standards .
i go to <unk> and i &apos;m going to go to a <unk> who may be 13 or 14 years old , and who &apos;s supposed to be an adult .
then i wonder : how could that happen ?
how can a judge someone into something that he isn &apos;t ?
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
one night , i stayed up too long and thought , my god , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he has to have <unk> .
right , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you should also wish which wish .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think so much , i started working on a sheep .
i had a <unk> , poor black young boy .
and i started to do this . the headline said , &quot; look , my poor , black black character like a <unk> , white , <unk> <unk> . &quot;
in my uncle , i explained that <unk> and police should be <unk> .
there was a crazy line about the fact that , in this country , there &apos;s nothing more <unk> that there are only accidents .
the next morning i woke up , and i didn &apos;t know if i was just reading this crazy thing or actually written it .
and i didn &apos;t just write it up , but sent to the court .
a few months went on , and i &apos;ve just forgotten everything .
but eventually i decided , my god , i have to go to the court and this crazy case .
i went to the car and was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought this is so hard , so painful .
eventually , i got out of my car , and i went up to the dish .
when i went out to the court , there was an older , black man , who was in the court .
when he saw me , he came up to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and <unk> me .
then he came to the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power .
there &apos;s something very deep inside me , identity , the ability to create something to a community , a perspective of hope .
well , i went to the <unk> .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , have you asked this crazy thing ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started talking .
more and more people came in , just because they were angry .
i wrote these crazy things .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
it was the <unk> full of people who were angry that we talked about color , about poverty , about inequality .
from my eye , i saw the wheels and down .
he kept looking through the window , and he could hear the whole thing .
he went up and down .
eventually , this older black man came in with a very <unk> <unk> and sat right behind me , almost to the <unk> .
ten minutes later , judge judge a break .
and during the break , there was a <unk> in it , and it turned out that the <unk> was in <unk> .
this <unk> led to the older black black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what are you doing in the <unk> ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he looked at the <unk> , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here to say to this young man , you don &apos;t lose the goal . don &apos;t give up . &quot;
i &apos;ve come to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral <unk> of the universe is far away , but it &apos;s the justice <unk> .
we as humans evolved as humans as humans , as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and care .
that our survival survival is connected to survival .
that we have to connect our visions of technology and design , about entertainment and creativity , to humanity , compassion and justice .
and most of all , i want to just see those of you who are just going to say , don &apos;t lose your goal out of your eyes . don &apos;t give up .
you &apos;ve seen in this audience , this community , a obvious wish to help them and do something .
what can we do ?
<unk> <unk> : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a <unk> in this spring where it &apos;s actually about creating a effort to actually do something about the <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> otherwise into politics .
here , in california , in the next five years , in the next five years , you &apos;re going to have a billion dollars for the death church .
and yet , 46 percent of all the time don &apos;t end up with <unk> .
97 percent of the <unk> come in front of court .
there &apos;s a chance to do something .
this <unk> is going to suggest the money in more and safety .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
over the last three decades , the <unk> in america has grown down .
this is the fact that the fact that this fact is going to be asked into context with the <unk> .
what would you say to someone who believes ?
well , actually , the number of <unk> doesn &apos;t change very much .
most of the <unk> in this country didn &apos;t really find in class class .
it was the <unk> <unk> against drugs .
that &apos;s why the dramatic numbers come at high rates .
we have <unk> ourselves from the <unk> .
now we &apos;ve got &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , &quot; people are going to put up forever , for a <unk> , for the current good good , rather than that you have to force them to pay things up .
i think we have to do more to help people who become victims of death , not less .
and i think our words helps anybody help .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , you really have a string to do it .
they are an inspiring personality .
thank you for being at ted . thank you .
bin laden : bin death is a <unk> <unk> .
two : famine in somalia . m 3 : <unk> the police .
4 4 : <unk> <unk> : dangerous <unk> .
six : social resilience . 7 7 : 65 dead .
chapter 8 : <unk> . nine nine .
different speakers : <unk> . guns . ha .
recession . <unk> . egypt . syria . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just some of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- it would have been the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media will prefer to show us negative topics , because our minds exactly <unk> those issues .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
every day our senses will ever process much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because more importantly than our survival , the first line of all the information is part of our <unk> , the <unk> .
so the <unk> is our <unk> .
it <unk> all of the information on the search for the causes of danger in our environment .
so when we see the news , we prefer to keep negative news .
and the old word , &quot; if it <unk> , the demand is very true .
well , with all our digital devices , seven days a week , 24 hours a day of all this negative news , it &apos;s not a miracle that we &apos;re hiv-positive .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks it &apos;s always the world .
but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
perhaps the enormous progress that we &apos;ve made in the last century through a series of forces are so strong that it &apos;s possible for us to create a world in the next three decades .
now , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , <unk> , water and <unk> -- we already have .
and as humans , we are much better at getting problems in a very long term , but they eventually eventually overcome .
so let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century so that we can predict the development .
over the last 100 years the average life expectancy has more than doubled , which is the population of the world &apos;s population .
child mortality has increased by a tenth .
and that comes out that the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> care .
steve pinker has shown us that we &apos;re currently living in a very recent period of life .
and according to charles <unk> , the <unk> rate has gone from 25 percent to 80 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and a lot of people forget this .
and we increase our expectations constantly .
we actually defined poverty .
consider that a large percentage of americans living under the poverty of poverty , access to electricity , water , toilets , cotton , television , mobile phones and cars .
the richest of the last century , the <unk> of the earth , could never have been able to <unk> like this .
the basis for many of these are technologies , and they grow together .
my good friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that &apos;s going to do to information is based on the curve of moore &apos;s law &apos;s great power , and it has doubled all 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs about a million times less and a half times faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first , how do they go -- in good times , war or peace , recession , depression and <unk> .
this is the result of adding computers computers to build .
it <unk> for none of our big problems .
and also , despite their <unk> <unk> on the left , they &apos;re moving up .
so the growth itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of remarkable technologies all available .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; something that i call my friends in &quot; <unk> , &quot; sensors and networks , 3d printer that allow enable to bring the personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , freedom , <unk> and food , digital medicine and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the victory of <unk> amino watson on &quot; risk &quot; ?
that was the case .
i once looked at the newspapers and looked for the best headlines i could find .
i love this one : &quot; watson <unk> human enemy . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the language of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence of every owner of a product is available .
four years ago , ray kurzweil and i was here at ted a new university called &quot; contemporary university . &quot;
we bring our students to all these technologies , in particular focus on how they can be used to solve the big challenges of humanity .
and every year , we ask the students to create companies and products and services that live within a decade of positive life .
think about that a group of students today can affect the lives of billions of people today .
30 years ago , that was ridiculous .
today we can have companies that have done exactly this .
when i think of it , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about bringing a life of opportunities .
it &apos;s about creating your own complex currency .
it &apos;s <unk> , and technology is a resource of resources .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of <unk> to dinner .
<unk> soldiers received <unk> , <unk> himself .
but the king of <unk> still got <unk> .
venus at that time was the most valuable metal on the planet , as gold and <unk> .
this is why the dome of the <unk> is made out of venus .
even though <unk> <unk> percent of the world &apos;s population goes forward , it &apos;s not a permanent metal .
it &apos;s being connected by oxygen and <unk> .
but then technology was developed and made <unk> so cheap that we use it with our <unk> .
and let &apos;s move this analogy to the future .
we now think of <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet that &apos;s more energy than we use a year .
16 percent energy takes all the <unk> minutes of the earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not <unk> , the problem is <unk> .
and there &apos;s good news .
this year , for the first time , it was done for the first time to reduce oil in india to 50 percent of the u.s. market -- <unk> rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar prices last year by 50 percent last year .
we published this with a study that shows that by the end of this decade , to the end of this decade in the u.k. areas of the united states , $ six cents a gallon , compared to 15 cents in the national average .
and if we have a <unk> , we &apos;ll have water in the water .
talk about <unk> .
remember , when carl did the <unk> in 1990 when it was on saturn , back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . what was it like ?
&quot; a <unk> blue <unk> . &quot;
because we live on a <unk> .
we live on a planet that is 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent green , two percent are <unk> , and we &apos;re fighting percent of the water on the planet , but there are hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the way , <unk> .
and from a conversation this morning , with dean <unk> , who i &apos;d like to share with you , who i want to share with you -- he gave me permission -- his <unk> , called &quot; <unk> , &quot; which many of you may have heard about -- it &apos;s the size of a <unk> in the <unk> .
it can generate a thousand gallons of clean drinking water a day from different sources -- whether water , clean water , <unk> -- and all this for less than two cents a gallon .
the head of coca-cola has just been <unk> to start with a hundred units in developing countries .
and if it &apos;s fine , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola will apply global globally in <unk> countries all over the planet .
this is <unk> innovation that we have today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in cell phones .
you mean , we &apos;re going to get 70 percent from mobile phones in developing countries to end .
remember that a <unk> with a mobile phone in the middle of kenya has a better <unk> than president reagan was 25 years ago .
and if you look at google with your smartphone , you have more access to knowledge and information than president clinton was 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in abundance , as nobody could have ever imagined .
and it comes even better , the things that you &apos;ve spent and i spent several thousand dollars -- gps , <unk> and photograph , libraries full of books and music , technology for medical engineering -- are now literally <unk> and cheaper in their mobile phone .
and the best part of this is perhaps what we expected in health .
in the last month , i &apos;ve had pleasure , which was called $ 10 million <unk> x x prize .
we teach teams around the world to connect all of these technologies together in a cell cell that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s associated with parkinson &apos;s , you can test <unk> or your <unk> .
and to win , the device needs to provide a better diagnosis as a team .
imagine this device : in the middle of a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the <unk> and 1.3 percent of health care .
if this device is familiar with a <unk> or a <unk> , which is not known , call it the <unk> and <unk> a pandemic in front of you .
but now the biggest force that will lead us to a world of failure .
i call them &quot; the next billion . &quot;
the white lines are population .
we just <unk> the <unk> .
and by the way , the largest <unk> against a population is better education and diet all over the world .
in 2010 , we just had two billion people online .
by 2020 , we get <unk> from two to five billion .
three billion new heads that we &apos;ve never heard before , become the global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to consume ?
and instead of looking down , i see one of the greatest economic <unk> in history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that are going to flow into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be healthier by the use of the <unk> , and they &apos;ll be trained by the <unk> , and by doing so they &apos;ll be able to use 3d 3d and <unk> cells , and much more productive than ever before .
so what can we bring 3 billion growing , healthy , generous , productive members of <unk> ?
how about a sentence , never before <unk> voices .
how would it be that , in fact , wherever you are , to give a voice to wonder and change change , for the first time ?
what are these three billion people ?
how about <unk> that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned from the x prize is that small teams who are motivated by writing and focus , extraordinary things can create , things that can only create great companies and governments in the past .
i want to finish with a story that really fascinated me .
there &apos;s a program that may already know .
it &apos;s a game called <unk> .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where individuals can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein will evolve .
depending on its behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in <unk> .
so far , this was a problem designed .
and this game was played by university .
and there are hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that these days the human activity better make the proteins better than the best ones .
and when these people came and looked , who was the best way in the world , was this not a <unk> , not a <unk> , that was somebody from england , married , a woman who was working on the day as a <unk> , and night the best way in the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me a lot of faith in our future is the fact that today we have more power than individuals to give us the big challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with technology .
we have the passion of a <unk> .
we have the capital of <unk> .
and we have three billion new heads that we can work online to address the new challenges , and to do that .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to do something against a <unk> piece of medical culture .
and i think it begins with a cancer , and that &apos;s me .
and maybe i &apos;ve been in business for a long time when i can give it a piece of my own false <unk> to enable this .
but before i come to the actual theme of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we are close to the <unk> and move on the world .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; seems soon and turns about statistics , and to use that great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to share on a statistics that i hope most of you have heard of .
it &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 , when a cup of 300 stops .
what that means is that the player is certainly 3 of 10 <unk> .
this is called the ball into the <unk> , he &apos;s coming up , he &apos;s not going to get caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball up to the first , didn &apos;t have any time in time and in safety .
three .
do you know how to call a <unk> in <unk> <unk> baseball ?
good , really good , maybe a <unk> .
do you know how to call a <unk> ?
this is somebody who is safe in the rest of four .
<unk> -- like ted williams <unk> -- the last <unk> <unk> player who met over 400 times over 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , where i feel a lot more difficult or maybe a little less comfortable with you .
suppose you have a <unk> , and you &apos;re going to be a <unk> , which is <unk> 400 in terms of <unk> .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine living in a particular remote area , and you have a passionate person with <unk> <unk> and her <unk> <unk> that led to a <unk> whose <unk> is 200 .
but you know what ?
it &apos;s much better this year . it &apos;s on the <unk> .
and she <unk> a <unk> .
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;ll ask you a question .
what do you believe like the <unk> for a <unk> or a nurse or a <unk> , a <unk> , should be a <unk> ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is nobody in all medicine knows what a good surgeon or doctor or <unk> should be .
what we do , however , is that every one of you , to me , to be perfect with the world .
never make a mistake , but nobody will worry about the details of how this should be done .
and that &apos;s the message i took in the <unk> .
i was a <unk> student student .
in high school , a lawyer said that brian <unk> would learn for a <unk> .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little <unk> <unk> at toronto general hospital at toronto general hospital , <unk> from here .
i learned everything .
in my <unk> , i learned the origins and the <unk> each , every branch of one of them , depending on the <unk> , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i even knew <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i spent more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i went off with <unk> <unk> .
and i left the <unk> with the impression that , if i knew anything , and everything knew , or at least as much as possible , as close to as possible , that i was going to be the <unk> of mistakes .
and it worked for a while until i met a woman .
i was <unk> on a <unk> here in toronto , as a woman , bought me into the <unk> of the hospital .
at that point , i was the <unk> layer at <unk> service .
and it was my assignment , as the <unk> <unk> advice to study the <unk> .
and feedback to my <unk> .
i was interviewed woman and she was in <unk> .
and when i <unk> her , she made sound sounds .
and when i was watching her chest with the <unk> , i was able to hear a <unk> sound on both sides that told me that they were suffering under <unk> .
this is a state in which the heart failed , instead of moving all the blood on the surface , there &apos;s a part of the blood in the lung , and you put that closer , so the <unk> came .
and it wasn &apos;t a difficult thing to do .
i hired them and made me treatment .
i gave her an academic . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call <unk> , water , so they <unk> the liquid .
and over a period of a year to two hours , she started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
actually , i made two mistakes .
i sent them home without my <unk> .
i didn &apos;t take it up , and i did what i had to have , what a call would have been with my <unk> , so that he had a chance to have a own picture .
and he knew that he was able to have extra information to her .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a doctor .
maybe i wanted to succeed so successful and so able to take responsibility that i was so upset , so that i would be able to have to worry about without him .
my second mistake was worse .
so this is what i sent you home , i <unk> a quiet voice in me trying to say to me , &quot; hey , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in fact , i was so interested in <unk> that i asked the nurse to take care of women &apos;s printer , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay if you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and he said , &quot; yeah , i think you &apos;ll do well . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
so i got the <unk> and a <unk> and <unk> came and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day i had this <unk> feeling in my stomach .
but i kept working on .
and at the end of the day , i got my stuff , he went to the hospital and went to the parking station to drive the car home when i did something i didn &apos;t .
i went home on my way home .
and there was another nurse who said another nurse , not the sister who saw the house of woman , but another three words told me , and those three words , most of them i know .
other scientists fear this as well , but the most special one is particularly because we see the patients just so close .
the three words : remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient ? &quot;
asked the nurse .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular <unk> .
so she was back .
she was back and dying .
about an hour after she arrived at home , after i left her home , she would break her , and the family came back to the <unk> with a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous <unk> .
she hardly breathe and was blue <unk> .
the <unk> moved all the strands .
they gave her <unk> .
they sent them to the <unk> .
i was shocked and into the inner <unk> .
and i came up with this observation because she came out and i hoped she was going to recover .
and after two , three days realized she was never going to go back .
she didn &apos;t have a <unk> .
your family grew up .
and over the next eight or nine days , you get to the <unk> .
the day they <unk> them -- woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
it &apos;s said that you never touched the names of those .
and that was the first time i learned that myself .
the next weeks i did for myself , and i learned that for the first time , the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself , isolated , not the kind of bad shame you would feel , because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
you all know the healthy shame , if you give a secret of the best friend , even though this one is at <unk> , and then you get caught , and the best friend you know , and my best discussion leads when you end up with the bad sense , and you realize that you never make such a mistake again .
if you do <unk> and never make the mistake again .
this is the kind of <unk> shame .
the most vulnerable way i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you feel sick .
it &apos;s the one who says it &apos;s not what you &apos;ve done , but you &apos;re bad .
and that &apos;s what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t based on my <unk> ; he was very angry .
he talked to the family , and i &apos;m sure he had the <unk> and sure that i wasn &apos;t going to hurt .
but i asked these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the <unk> ? why did i go home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make such a bad mistake ?
why am i going to the medicine ?
slowly , slowly , it turned out .
i started feeling better .
and then on a <unk> day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke up , and i may tell myself better .
and i was talking to me that if i grew up my efforts and never made a mistake that the voice could <unk> .
and she did .
and i continued to work .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had a service in the <unk> hospital north of toronto , and i <unk> a 25 years old man with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot of go .
he always showed up here .
i looked in the <unk> , and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a <unk> <unk> .
and when he went out of the door , he showed his <unk> .
two days later , i came to my next <unk> , and my <unk> asked me a conversation to her office .
and she said the three words : remember ?
&quot; remember patients with the <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
it turned out to be a <unk> .
he had a <unk> disease called <unk> .
you can see that , but it &apos;s not an infection of the <unk> , but the top <unk> and causes the <unk> of the <unk> .
and fortunately he died .
he got <unk> <unk> and <unk> a few days later .
and i went back through the same <unk> of shame and <unk> , i felt <unk> and went to work until it again and again .
in a <unk> i have two times a <unk> .
i &apos;ve heard a lot about it , especially if you think you &apos;re working in a hospital that was just 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was no career in their treatment .
i thought he would have been <unk> .
i put the radio on the kidneys , and when i was in my colleague , my colleague at the <unk> of the patient was in the lower right sector and called the <unk> .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
i <unk> <unk> to <unk> and asked my colleagues as well .
and that &apos;s what he did , and when he was in the right lower sector , he called the <unk> .
they were in both cases , and it was good .
both of them are <unk> to me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistakes only has happened in the first five years , which is a lot of my colleagues say , but it &apos;s <unk> nonsense .
some of my favorites happened in the last five years .
alone , <unk> and no support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t close with my mistakes and talk about them , if i agree the quiet voice that tells me what really happened , how do i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my mistakes so that they don &apos;t commit the same ?
if i was in a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you think about me .
when did you hear this last time from talking about <unk> on <unk> ?
oh yeah , you go to a minority party and you may hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody about the own mistakes .
if i were to go into a room full of colleagues and ask them to tell them what i just told you , i would probably not reach the end of the second story , before they really hurt them , somebody would have a joke , they would change a joke and forget the rest .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues that a <unk> would have had the wrong leg in my hospital , believe me , i had had trouble looking in the eyes .
that &apos;s the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a totally <unk> of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t make . those who don &apos;t do it -- those who don &apos;t have the <unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> and the good results .
it &apos;s almost a <unk> reaction as antibodies that attack a human being .
and there is the idea that if we take those who make mistakes from medicine , that we have a safe system .
but there are two problems .
in my roughly 20 years of medical school and journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal medical study on medical mistakes and wrong treatments to make it all possible for one of my first article i made for the toronto star to my show , &quot; white <unk> , black art . &quot;
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely essential .
we &apos;re working in a system that will happen every day in which one in 10 <unk> either is a false or wrong , in which <unk> is always and more and more and more expensive or dead or dead .
in this state , they die , they die of <unk> mistakes .
in the united states , the institute of medicine is 100,000 .
both are strong <unk> , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as much as we should .
and it &apos;s the <unk> .
in a <unk> where medical knowledge has doubled every two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get it out .
we own a cognitive mistake so that we can take a perfect <unk> for a patient .
then i &apos;m going to take the same patient with <unk> , do it <unk> and <unk> , and i &apos;ll give you a slightly <unk> breath , and all of a sudden the story is <unk> .
i don &apos;t take the same thing .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always make things the same .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms always in the same way .
all of these are mistakes inevitable .
so if you take the system , as i was taught , and you &apos;ve got all the <unk> <unk> , then at the end nobody &apos;s left .
and you know the <unk> about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , &quot; white <unk> , black &quot; i have said to say , &quot; this is my greatest mistake , &quot; i would say to each of the <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , &quot; this is my greatest mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; what about her ? &quot; and then i &apos;ll show with the microphone .
and then their <unk> moves , they &apos;re in front of their head , they look down , they &apos;re hard , they start telling stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes that i &apos;m doing . &quot;
what they need is a environment that allows them to do that .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new <unk> doctor is a human , white for his humanity , accepted it , is not proud to make mistakes , but it &apos;s all about learning from them so that it can be passed .
they share their experiences with others .
they support when others talk about their mistakes .
and they show others their mistakes , not to <unk> , but in a <unk> , <unk> way of all benefit .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life , and if that &apos;s like that , people too do mistakes at time .
so the system that the system can actually evolve is to create <unk> that make it easier to make mistakes that people make , and it &apos;s also allowed possible to create creative spaces in which anyone who sees health care can actually predict things that potential mistakes and that &apos;s actually going to reward , and especially for people like me who are going to make mistakes and are going to reward these things .
my name is brian kennedy .
i &apos;m the new <unk> doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
i &apos;m <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn from that to make it different .
i don &apos;t know what they think of me , but that &apos;s what i can live with .
let me close with three words of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories to use time .
the first story about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know he was standing here .
you may think he &apos;s <unk> , but that &apos;s not true .
actually , he collected fish .
he described one of them as very , very common .
it was a <unk> .
up to the 1980s , he was <unk> in great style .
now it &apos;s on the red list of endangered species .
we &apos;ve heard this story a lot of times from the galapagos or other places , and it &apos;s not very special .
yet , we &apos;re still coming to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the <unk> describe it still as <unk> .
what happened here ?
the second story should be a different concept , the <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
because i experienced it when i studied a <unk> in <unk> .
i went there because i grew up in europe , and i wanted to work on africa later .
i thought i could introduce myself .
and i got a terrible <unk> , and i was convinced that i really wasn &apos;t there .
it was my first <unk> .
as you can see , the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> were <unk> .
there were <unk> of about 20 <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> , and the fishermen lived well , and they were good in ghana .
when i got there 27 years later , the fish was on half of his size .
five inches five inches .
they were genetically <unk> .
it was still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish was lucky enough to be there .
so it didn &apos;t change , and yet everything has changed .
my third little story tells me about my favorite story at the introduction of <unk> .
in the &apos; 70s , in the beginning of the &apos; 60s , europe has many <unk> .
<unk> used countries , which is already 100 thousand fish , the industrial tower , this fairly ugly ship called <unk> 4 .
i went on to this , and we did all the southern <unk> sea , and particularly in the <unk> .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
now i know it was the cause of the sea .
90 percent of our <unk> were isolated , other animals that are connected to the cause .
most of the fish , the little dots there on the top , the <unk> , were <unk> .
basically , the bottom of the ocean came up , and then it turned out .
these images are extraordinary because the transition goes really fast .
within a year , you &apos;re going to take a walk through it , and then it starts with the force .
that &apos;s the reason it &apos;s changing . it &apos;s -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft coral is <unk> .
this is a dead story .
they weren &apos;t eaten , they threw them away because they were dead .
once we started a alive .
she wasn &apos;t <unk> .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain of <unk> is every time you drive into areas where you &apos;ve never been <unk> .
it &apos;s not going to be documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we fit our <unk> to the new level , and we wouldn &apos;t call ourselves in memory what was there .
if you look at it , this is what happens .
on the y-axis , some good things : biodiversity , number of <unk> , the green of your country , the <unk> .
over time , it changes . it changes because people are , of course , their actions .
every generation looks at the images that they refer to their lives in the beginning of their lives as a standard , and it &apos;s all going to happen .
the difference is then considered loss .
but you don &apos;t take the previous losses true .
there can be a sequence of change .
and at the end of all , they just want to get <unk> .
right now , that &apos;s our goal .
we want to get things that have disappeared or things that are no longer as they were .
you might think that the problem with people who certainly lived when they lived in <unk> societies , animals and whom were aware of what they were doing .
because obviously an animal that gave it very often , first rarely before it <unk> .
so you don &apos;t lose a lot of <unk> animals .
you lose rare animals always .
and so it &apos;s not as big loss .
over time , we focus on the big animals and the sea are the big fish .
they &apos;re <unk> because we start them .
over time , there &apos;s little fish left , and we think that &apos;s the <unk> .
the question is , why people accept this .
well , because you don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , a lot of people , scientists , suggest that it was really different .
you &apos;ll notice it because the evidence , as you &apos;re in a earlier form , are not the way you would like to argue the evidence .
for example , there is , for example , that the report of a <unk> in this area can &apos;t be used in this area that this area can &apos;t be used , or by <unk> , usually , because it &apos;s not scientifically .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the huge big role that can play a grid .
because we basically make the past back .
we make the past back that people can &apos;t understand because the <unk> changes are very low and very low .
so , you can see the people who see a grid , and they can benefit from the glimpse of it , allowing it to <unk> their <unk> .
what about the people who can &apos;t do it because they have no access -- the people in the middle west , for example ?
here , i think the art and the film might fill the gap , as well as <unk> .
this is the simulation of the bay bay .
a long time ago there was <unk> -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> may remind you of &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think about heaven , if you think about why people were so touched by this -- apart from the <unk> , why were they so touched by the <unk> ?
because there &apos;s something that &apos;s lost in a certain way .
so , my guess , the only one i &apos;m going to give up to cameron , so that he &apos;s called &quot; <unk> ii &quot; underwater .
thank you .
in the 1980s , in the &apos; 80s , <unk> , you had to , if you had an expert , that was in government .
they also had to be a sheet of <unk> from this <unk> .
the reason for this : the government could fix where a text was .
they found an article with <unk> <unk> , they were able to figure out the grandmother of that thought .
and in the west , we couldn &apos;t understand how anyone would do this , and how much that would <unk> the freedom .
in our own countries we would never do that .
but in 2011 today , if you buy a new <unk> from the leading <unk> and a page , that page <unk> yellow <unk> on every side , in a pattern that is clearly clear to you and your printer .
this is what happens to us today .
nobody seems <unk> .
and that was an example of how our own governments technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the three <unk> of the existing <unk> .
let &apos;s take a look at what &apos;s happening in the world : we can split the attacks in categories .
we have three <unk> .
there are <unk> .
for example , here &apos;s mr. <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
and the <unk> are very easy to understand .
these guys deserve money .
they use <unk> to make a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
there are several known cases of <unk> , <unk> , who made their money through government .
this is <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
this is alfred <unk> .
stephen watts .
<unk> <unk> .
these are <unk> anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so on .
these people have come online to wealth , but they &apos;ve made it illegal by using for example , for example , to give money out of our <unk> , while we &apos;re doing our <unk> , or the <unk> that our <unk> have collected over the keyboard while we fire over a local computer online .
the american intelligence <unk> <unk> two months ago there was a swiss <unk> <unk> here , and on this country , <unk> million dollars , when it was frozen .
mr. <unk> himself is <unk> , the <unk> is unknown .
and i want to argue that today , today , we &apos;re going to become victims of a <unk> , as a disaster in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is even worse .
in the future , most crime are playing online .
the second <unk> we can see today is not by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- sort of , an opinion , or by your audience .
groups like rats have become over the last 12 months , and they &apos;ve become one of the <unk> on the field of <unk> .
so these are the three <unk> : criminals who are doing money from doing things like nuclear weapons who afford resistance , but the last group of nations are nations , governments that lead the attacks .
there &apos;s cases going on , like <unk> .
it shows what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> from the netherlands -- or was it .
last fall , it had to be <unk> , because <unk> had been <unk> .
somebody was <unk> and had the system built .
and last week in a meeting , i asked one of the students to ask the question whether he died it possible for possible .
and his answer was yes .
now , how are people dying in a row like this ?
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
well , you need a <unk> , if you have a website with <unk> , with <unk> , for example .
now we &apos;re going to use all of us , or many of us , <unk> or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly common in <unk> states like iran , where <unk> foreign <unk> are using <unk> , because they know that they can trust more trust than local systems , and that they are <unk> to the local government , so the local government can &apos;t <unk> in their students .
but you can , if you look at a foreign policy .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and this is exactly what happens in <unk> .
what about the arab spring and the things that are happening in egypt ?
now , in egypt , the <unk> in april , in the april , <unk> <unk> , and they found a lot of them .
it was a called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and in this case , notes in germany had sold a few programs that were sold in a few programs that they had -- in a very large framework -- any communication of mental citizens .
they had sold this program for <unk> dollars to the government .
this is right there .
so western governments are <unk> governments with <unk> for their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
so , for example , in germany , just a few weeks ago , we found that was a <unk> that was used by german <unk> to <unk> their own citizens .
if you get <unk> in a <unk> , your phone will be safe .
but today we are far beyond that .
they <unk> their internet .
they use tools like <unk> to <unk> their computer with a <unk> that allows them to monitor their entire communication , their <unk> , their <unk> .
so if we keep thinking about things like this , the obvious answer of people would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t matter me because i &apos;m a <unk> citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy must be given .
privacy is not about debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we today , in 2011 , our governments like trust , is every right we &apos;ve done forever .
and trust , we trust a every future government , a government that we may have in 50 years ?
these are the questions we have to do with the next 50 years .
it may seem strange to you , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> were created <unk> and <unk> of a simple idea : <unk> of gold with <unk> <unk> .
<unk> became very quickly , very quickly , <unk> <unk> in the world .
they were able to build things that were bigger than us , buildings , bridges , one stone after the other .
essentially , the <unk> had become a place of our time .
a hundred years later , in 1970 , lego came out .
it was called the automatically <unk> stone .
and within a few years , lego fell into every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on the planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create nice houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful building .
lego made it possible for everyone .
lego basically has the <unk> , the building in the world , made a building for our imagination .
in the meantime , the next year in bell was the next revolution , the next one .
the transistor was a little <unk> that took us from a world of <unk> , <unk> blocks to a world in everything .
like the <unk> , allows us to build much larger , more complex , one stone after the other .
but there &apos;s a <unk> : the transistor was only for experts .
personally , i don &apos;t agree that the building of our time is for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started studying this idea of how to put the power of engineers into the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing <unk> .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic websites that have specific function .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , sound , motor and <unk> .
and the best thing about this is they connect with them .
you can &apos;t get them wrong .
the stones are <unk> .
green is <unk> , blue is electricity , pink is <unk> and orange is cable .
so all you have to do is connect a blue and a green one , and you can build bigger <unk> .
you put a blue on a green , and you can make light .
you can break a switch in between , and so they created a little <unk> .
take the switch out to be a <unk> , which is <unk> , and they made a little <unk> .
and then they add this <unk> effect for a extra effect , and they made a <unk> .
i &apos;ll stop that .
so the simple game , in fact , is pretty powerful .
instead of trying to code , <unk> or <unk> allows you to code with simple , intuitive gestures .
so to speed up , or slow down , just turn on that button , and it makes the amount faster or slower .
the idea behind <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction in this world into a <unk> stone .
lights , sound , <unk> , motors -- everything should be available .
we have <unk> on kids , and they see it playing with it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , as you start to understand the electronics that you &apos;re learning in everyday america and you don &apos;t learn in school .
for example , a <unk> works , or why the doors of the <unk> , or the ipod on touch .
we also have <unk> .
so we had , for example , designers with no experience in electronic things that began to play with <unk> as material .
here we see , with <unk> , paper and <unk> , like <unk> ...
a couple of weeks ago , we had brought together <unk> , and they gave some designers who had no technical experience -- just fire , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; power what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is actually my <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> that fear has in darkness .
for this <unk> , <unk> was another material , electronics was just another material .
and we want to do this material for everyone .
so <unk> open source .
you can go to the website , all the <unk> and <unk> them .
we want to take the world of the elites , the inventor , the <unk> encourage , because this world , in which we live , this interactive world .
so , pull out and start invent .
thank you .

you know , one of the great themes in training , and one of the pleasures in the most powerful research , is to live with the people who remember the old days , the past their past still sense of the wind , taste them in the bitter sheets of plants .
just knowing that climate change is still going beyond the milky way , or the meaning of the oldest of the inuit &apos;s oldest inuit is full of meaning , or that in the himalayas , the buddhist is still following the breath of the <unk> , that means that the world in which we live , doesn &apos;t exist in an absolute sense , it &apos;s the idea that the world in which we are living doesn &apos;t exist in absolute meaning , but just as a model of reality , as a result of a group of certain
and of course , we all share the same basic themes .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing children to the world .
we &apos;re going through <unk> .
we have to deal with the inexorable separation by death , and so we should not surprise that we all have to sing and dance and create art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique inflection of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
in the process , it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s <unk> in the forests of borneo , or the <unk> in haiti , or the warriors in the streets of <unk> , the <unk> in the andes , or a <unk> in the middle of sahara . this is happen to be the colleague that i &apos;ve traveled to the desert a month ago , or even a propagandist on the slopes of the <unk> , everest , the mother of the world .
all of these people are teaching us that there are other differences , other ways of thinking , other ways of accessing the earth .
and that &apos;s an idea that , if you think about it , can only satisfy you with hope .
together , myriad cultures of the world form a net of <unk> and cultural life that will make the earth , and it &apos;s just as important to the earth as the biological landscape that you know as a biosphere .
you can think of this cultural realm of cultural as an equal state , and in fact , <unk> can be thought of as the interconnectedness of all thoughts and dreams , myths , inspiration and intuitions that have been driven by human imagination since the beginnings of consciousness .
the inflationary world is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we are capable of as an amazing species of species .
and just as the biosphere got heavily worn , it happened with <unk> -- only at greater speed .
no biologist would say , for example , that 50 percent or more of the species are just about to go extinct , because it just isn &apos;t right , and yet , this -- the most powerful thing in the field of biological diversity -- doesn &apos;t really equal to what &apos;s known as <unk> in the field of cultural diversity .
and the crucial indicator of that is the extinction of languages .
when each of you were born in this room , there were 6,000 languages spoken on the earth .
now , language is not just the sum of the vocabulary or a series of <unk> .
a language is the expression of the human mind .
it is a means in which the soul of a particular culture finds access to the material world .
each language is like a veritable forest of the mind , a pivotal point , an idea , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and of those 6,000 languages today , as we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , the half are no longer related to children &apos;s ears .
they &apos;re no longer taught infants . that means if nothing &apos;s done , they &apos;re actually dead already .
what could be lonely than to be the silent one , to be one of the last of your people who speak your language , not have a way to pass the wisdom of the ancestors , or expect your children ?
and yet , this terrible destiny actually has someone somewhere on earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , an older man dies and takes the last <unk> of old language to the grave .
and i know some of you are saying , &quot; well , it &apos;s not better ? &quot; if the world is not a better place , if we all would speak one language , &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s do that kind of language . let &apos;s be <unk> .
let &apos;s be kogi . &quot;
and then suddenly , you would see what it would be like if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
so today , i &apos;d like to take you through a journey through the <unk> , a brief journey through the <unk> , to try to understand them , understand what &apos;s actually lost .
now there are some of us that are somewhat forgotten that , in some sense , when i say , i say , &quot; different means of being , &quot; really different means of being .
for instance , take this child of <unk> in the west of the amazon , the people of <unk> , believe that they went from the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
this is a people who are not cognitively different between the color of blue and green because the fabric of the forest that affects humans is <unk> .
you have an curious language , and you have an odd language called linguistic <unk> : you have to marry someone who speaks a different language .
all of this is rooted in the dark past . the curious houses of these big houses that are spoken on the basis of six or seven languages , is that you never hear anyone who learns one language .
you just hear and start talking .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the main people in the suburbs of ecuador , was some amazing people , the first time in 1958 , was contacted .
in 1957 , five missionaries had tried to record and make a simpler mistake .
they threw down shiny photos from the air , which we thought of as a friendly act , and they forgot that these people in their lives had never seen anything more substantial in their lives .
they took those photographs out of the forest floor , trying to see behind the face or the character , didn &apos;t find that they were business business and they killed the five missionaries with the spear .
but they were not only killing sheep in the spear .
they were breeding each other .
54 percent of the deaths happened through <unk> .
we went back to eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we faced people with vigorously about it , they announced that one of the people had become so old that he died because of his age , and we still killed him with the spear .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest that was amazing .
their crops could smell the urine of an animal from 40 steps away , and determine what animal species owned .
in the early 1990s , i got a really amazing job when my professor at harvard asked if i was interested in going to haiti and infiltrate the secret societies that were the foundation of the strength of <unk> and <unk> , and the poison that was used to make a difference .
in order to make sense of that effect , i had to know something about this remarkable belief of well-being , and voodoo is not a cult of the black magic .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complicated metaphysical worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked you to recall the great world religions , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , <unk> or whatever .
a continent is always out there , because the guess was that sub-saharan africa is not a religious belief , and , of course , in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious belief , and , of course , it &apos;s simply the remnant of this very deep religious thought that was held in the tragic diaspora of <unk> .
but what makes it interesting is this vivid relationship between the living and the dead .
the lives are the spirits .
the minds can go from under the great water , answers to the rhythm of the dance , to suppress the soul of the living temporarily , so that the <unk> for a brief milestone moment becomes god .
<unk> people like to say , &quot; you white go to church and talk about god .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you are obsessed , you &apos;re going to take off the mind , how can you harm ?
look at these amazing demonstrations : nassau , in a trance , which is the hot coal with no combustion <unk> , an amazing illustration of the ability of the mind to influence the body that this is when it is enforced in a state of extreme arousal .
now , of all the people i &apos;ve met were the kogi from the sierra nevada of delhi , the most special .
offspring of the ancient <unk> civilization that peak the caribbean coastal coastal areas of columbia , and in the aftermath of conquest , these people moved in a <unk> , massive way to get that across the coastal coastal plain .
in a <unk> continent , these people were the only ones conquered by the romans .
by day day , you become by a ritual priesthood , but the training to the priesthood is very extraordinary .
the young ones are separated by the age of three and four years from their families , and in a worldwide world of darkness , at the top of the glacier of the glacier for 18 years -- two periods of each time at the top of nine years , deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of pregnancy that they were having in the lap of their mother &apos;s lap , now they are sitting in the lap of the great mother .
and during that whole period of time , they become culturally introduced to the values of their society , values that keep the claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say that ecological balance -- is permanent .
at the end of this amazing tube , one day , you will suddenly go outside , and for the first time in your life , at age 18 , you see a sunrise . and in this powerful moment of consciousness from the first light , when the sun begins to add on to remarkably beautiful landscapes , all of a sudden what you learned in the abstract is suddenly everything that you learned in the abstract scale , and the priest comes back and says , &quot; look , it &apos;s really what i told you .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you need to protect it . &quot;
they are calling their older brothers and saying that we are the younger brothers , who are the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
and whenever we think of the landscape and the landscapes , we either put ourselves together and the old myth of the fancy wild , which is a <unk> thought , or on the other hand , and say , these people are more connected to nature than we are .
so , <unk> are not sentimental , they &apos;re not <unk> by the nostalgia .
there &apos;s not a lot of room in the <unk> swamps of <unk> or the cold pyramid of tibet , but still , through time and ritual , you may have shaped a mystery of the earth , which is not based on the idea of being aware of it , but on a much more subtle intuition , the idea that the earth can exist only by itself , because it becomes human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little child from the andes , who grows up in believing that the mountain is a key one , who is the one that will be , or the fate of their fate , will be a very different human being , and a different relationship with that resource or this place , as a small child from montana who grows in believing that a mountain is a bunch of stones that can be worn .
whether it &apos;s a abode of a mind or a pile of anonymity , it &apos;s irrelevant .
and what &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the nature .
i grew up in the forests of british faso , and believed that these forests are designed to be <unk> .
and that made me think of another person as my friends among the <unk> , who believe that these forests are the abode of <unk> and the curved nose , and the most precious minds that live in the world &apos;s fourth world , minds that are going to involve them at their shores .
now , when you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , for example .
it &apos;s a photograph i took only last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is <unk> , which many of you have heard , the most powerful intensive intervention from the repertoire of the discoverable .
what &apos;s so fascinating is that it &apos;s not just the potential potential of this information system , but it &apos;s its process , it &apos;s built really out of two different sources . on one side , there &apos;s this wooden thread of plastic , which is a series of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , it &apos;s easy to fill up . it &apos;s a little bit like taking a blue <unk> smoke on your consciousness , but it &apos;s going to be filled with the leaves of a woodpecker from the family &apos;s family with the hidden
this plant contains some very strong pools of serotonin that serotonin and <unk> and <unk> are very similar .
so , if you &apos;ve seen the <unk> , how you &apos;ve seen this stuff , this substance that has made them out of different ways as well .
now transporting this powder is a little bit like being thrown out of a car cream , surrounded by <unk> paintings and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it will not create distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
in fact , i &apos;ve even been with my professor , richard evan <unk> , who &apos;s the man who &apos;s been able to pinpoint the magic mushroom in mexico in mexico , discussing it , and i said that you couldn &apos;t reset this notion as a <unk> , at the moment when you feel the impact , you &apos;re not there anymore to experience a hallucination .
but the thing about sulfates is that you can &apos;t get rid of it , because you walk through one in the human gut , of course , by the name of the human gut .
they can only put it in conjunction with some other chemicals that mao <unk> .
now , the fascinating thing is that , you know , the <unk> that are in the <unk> are the ones that are necessary , that are necessary to <unk> , so ask for yourself .
how can these people go from a flora of 80,000 species plants can &apos;t find plants that , if they combine this way , create a kind of narrative version , so that the whole larger than the sum of its parts is ?
we use this great euphemism , trial and error , which turns out to be meaningless .
but let &apos;s tell the indians , &quot; the plant is communicating to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
so this tribe , the <unk> , have 17 varieties of dna networks , which you all recognize at a great distance in the forest that seem like a species .
and then you ask them how to put their fingers up and say , &quot; i thought you understand something of plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
well , it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties of a full moon and you sing them in a different variety of ink .
now this doesn &apos;t bring you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting .
well , the problem with the problem is that even those of us who have the sympathy for the difficult state of hearing , they look at them as a partner , and they look at the past , but the real world , which is our world .
so , the fact is that , in the 20th century , in 300 years , you &apos;re not going to remember his wars or technical innovations , but rather than an era where we present and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on earth were either active or passively passively . so the problem is not change .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new families .
and the problem is not technology itself .
the <unk> stopped not being less on sioux when they were rowing and arrow when americans stopped being americans when they stopped being the horse and <unk> tasks .
not change and technology threaten the integrity of feminism , which is power . the ugly face of sovereignty .
and wherever you look in the world , you &apos;re going to discover that these cultures are not going to collapse to extinction , and these are dynamic living peoples that are displaced by their existence to be replaced by the basic means of customization , whether it &apos;s in the vastness of massive deforestation in the state of copyright health , which is in 1897 , of a people that lived in front of a generation in the forest , and now they were <unk> and prostitution in the coastal world , where you can see that even the
or when we go into the mountains of tibet where i do a lot of research , you will see the ugly face of political domination .
you know , the genocide , the reckless extinction of people , is convicted of general , but the most vulnerable , the destruction of people &apos;s lives , not only aren &apos;t convicted , but is widely celebrated as part of the human being .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering , if you haven &apos;t seen it on a <unk> level .
i started traveling with a young collaborator 6,000 miles from visionaries in <unk> <unk> to lhasa , and only when i came to lhasa , i saw the face behind the statistics of whom you were hearing . 6,000 holy monuments that were killed in rubble and ash . 1.2 million people who were murdered by the <unk> revolution .
the father of this young <unk> was identified as followers of the interstate lama .
this meant that he was assassinated during the chinese invasion .
his uncle fled his sanctity in the diaspora , bringing people to nepal .
his mother was locked in as punishment to be a fellowship for crimes .
he was smuggled into jail at the age of two , to hide under her companion , because she couldn &apos;t live .
and the sister who did the brave , who was hurting these brave , was brought into a rescue camp .
and one day she came out of a tags for seven years , and she had to go through a heavy labor camp for seven years .
the suffering can rearrange intolerable , but the mortal spirit of people is a little bit more elegant .
and in the end , we &apos;re really in front of a choice , and do we want to live in a more sheltered world of the world of the world , or in a sustainable world of diversity ?
margaret mead , the great anthropologist , said , before she died , that as we &apos;re moving towards a thread , <unk> , <unk> worldview , we &apos;re not just going to see all the bandwidth of the human imagination in a more difficult way , but that we &apos;d come out of a dream one day , and forget that we &apos;ve ever had other options .
and it &apos;s imperative to think that our species may have been around 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution that brought us agriculture , and in this moment , the cult of the <unk> <unk> , took the poetry of the <unk> through the prose of the priesthood and created a hierarchy and specialization and surplus -- only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world , as we know it , is hardly 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we have all the answers to the challenges we have in the ensuing millennia .
if we ask these myriad judgments about the meaning of human beings , you respond to 10,000 different voices .
and in this song we &apos;re going to be able to figure out what we are : people with fully consciousness that are aware of the importance that all humans and gardens have to thrive a space , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took at the northern end of the <unk> , when i went to the <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government has not always worked very well with the inuit , and during the intervening years of managing our sovereignty , they were forced to be in settlements .
the grandfather &apos;s old man refused .
the family , the fear of his life , took all the weapons and all the tools off .
now you have to know that the inuit are not afraid of the cold , they used it to their advantage .
the <unk> of their sled were originally made of fish <unk> .
the man &apos;s grandfather was not worried about the arctic night or the mouth storm .
he looked outside , took his pants out of <unk> down and <unk> into his hand , and when the feces started to market , he shaped it into the shape of a cafe .
he would spit out on the sides of the egg and when it was completely frozen , he renamed a dog .
he closes the dog and improvised a fulbright , took the skeleton of the dog and pan a sled , put a different dog on and forth on the top of the dog with the metal cone on the belt .
you can do something like this .
and this is a symbol of the resistance of the inuit and all native citizens in the world .
the canadian government had the canadian government in april 1999 , the complete control over an area that &apos;s bigger than california and texas combined .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called <unk> .
it &apos;s an independent area . they all control <unk> .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state that can look for the people who are in charge of their people .
and finally , i think it &apos;s kind of obvious , at least for those of us who &apos;ve traveled to these distant goals of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not removed at all .
you &apos;re the teaching of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination change throughout the past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children are becoming part of the geography of our own children .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is we believe that politicians never do anything .
we believe that <unk> , we believe , is not persuasive , but we think that storytelling can change the world , so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world , and our website gives 35 million people every month .
156 nations are broadcasting our process of dopamine .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we &apos;re going to run a series of trips into the sorts of questions where we take our audiences to places from such cultural wonders that they are blinded by the most you &apos;ve ever known , and hopefully , you &apos;re going to adopt one of the other ways of the central revelation of anthropology : that this world has earned , in many ways , that we can find a change in a truly multicultural plural world where the wisdom of all human beings can contribute to shared well-being .
thank you .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about , as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we have microsoft as part of a year ago , and it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s an environment where they can either deal with vast amounts of visual data .
we see many , many endlessly on digital photographs here , which are seamless and ongoing , and able to pan it in any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we &apos;re looking at , how big those collections are , or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this one , for example , is a scan of the library of congress , and it &apos;s in a domain of 300 watt-hours .
it doesn &apos;t make a difference , because the only thing that can limit the performance of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen right now , and it has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is evangelina house by dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s actually a text and not about a picture , we can actually do something like that , to really show you that this is a real representation of the interior and not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading a wall game .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a story .
and that really gives you the pleasure and the good experience to read a true magazine of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of a medium with multiple scales .
we &apos;ve also done something on the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we &apos;ve designed a false readout with very high resolution , which is much higher than a normal display , and we added more content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see it here .
or other models , or technical specs , even .
and this really manages these ideas to stop these constraints for the available place on the screen .
we hope that this is not pop-ups and other nonsense -- that shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
of course , mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t really want to spend a lot of time here , but to say that we will also contribute to that domain .
but these are all the streets in the coalmine .
nasa top at the university of nasa .
let &apos;s take a look at something else .
it &apos;s now live on the internet . you can pull it out .
this is a project called <unk> , which actually connects two different technologies .
one is <unk> , and the other is a very good research on <unk> , a university student at washington university , under the advice of steve <unk> at the university of washington .
and rick <unk> was done by microsoft &apos;s research , very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by <unk> .
you can see this when we create this kind of thinking , where we can penetrate through images and make that experience of the redundant resolution .
but the spatial orientation of imagery is actually important .
in fact , they put these images together in order to put them in the real space , in which these recordings that are all made near the united states period in the canadian desert , are equivalent to the elements of damage slides or <unk> , and these things have been put together in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i &apos;ve got time to show you other environments .
there are some which are much spatial .
i &apos;d like to show you the original data of noah , and this is from a early prototype from debris that we &apos;ve been working on in the summer to show you what i think is really the punchline behind this technology , the <unk> , and that &apos;s not necessarily so obvious when you look at the environments that we have on the website .
we had to start worrying about the lawyers and the other .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral notre dame who ran exclusively on the computer with pictures of flickr . give you notre dame in flickr and you &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-shirts and on the <unk> and so forth . every one of the orange dynamics represents a picture that was discovered in this model .
so these are all sorts of things , and they &apos;re all in perspective with this way .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
you know , i never thought i was going to work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
and i guess you can see that these are a lot of different kinds of cameras : it &apos;s all in the process of professional services , a pretty large number of you who are all in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the strange ones .
many of you are rolling up by your faces , etc .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- they are here .
this is actually a poster by notre dame who was recorded .
we can move from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with the social environment , and it &apos;s all collected data from all of the collective memory of how visual the earth looks -- and everything will be connected .
all these photographs are being connected , and there &apos;s something bigger than the sum of the parts .
they &apos;re getting a model that comes from all over the earth .
and think of this as the sequel of stephen <unk> on virtual earth .
and this is something that goes through the complexity that people use , and it &apos;s going to take advantage of the user &apos;s application forever .
your own photos are made by marvin <unk> , who entered another person .
if someone has made the trouble and created all of those saints who are all of them who are all of them , then my photo of notre <unk> , suddenly , is expressing all of that data , and i can use them as a starting to go into this room , into these <unk> , using photographs of other people and make a kind of <unk> social experience with the use of others .
and of course , of course , crude them are the immense rich virtual models of any interesting part of the earth that has not only been obtained by <unk> or satellite images and so forth , but through collective memory .
thank you .
i get it right ? how do you allow your software to be at some point in time , in the next years , all the images that are used by somebody in the world , in principle , in principle .
yeah . she &apos;s not making anything else more than exploration .
if they want it to be hyperlinks between the images .
and it does that because of the content in the images .
and this is really exciting when you think about the amount of semantic information that many of these images have .
how do you make a difference for images where you enter sentences and the text of the website has a lot of information about what this is .
but what if that image is linked to all its pictures ?
and then the volume of semantic falls and the abundance that come out of it is really enormous . it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
blaise , that &apos;s amazing . so congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you a couple of things from my book that i hope are in unison with other things that you &apos;ve heard about , and i &apos;m going to try to make myself a few connections , if you haven &apos;t noticed them .
i want to start what i call &quot; official dogma . &quot;
so the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all western industrialized societies .
the official dogma works like this : if our goal is to maximize the good causes of our citizens , this is largely due to the freedom of freedom of the individuals .
the reason for this is that freedom is in itself good , valuable , productive , a darwinian premise for human beings .
when people have freedom , each of us is about to do the things that maximize our good good , and no one has to decide for us .
the path to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices have people , the more freedom you have , and the more freedom you have , the more common you have .
this is , i think , deeply deep in our water reserves that no one in the mind would come to mind .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us progress in modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i &apos;ll just quickly say a little bit about here .
there are 175 charities in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t pay the 10 different <unk> and 12 <unk> that you could buy to create a large number of your lettuce , in the unlikely case , that no one of the predicted in the store is right for you .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then they go to the <unk> store around a stereo for a stereo -- speaker , <unk> , a <unk> , radio , emergency , and in this one electronics , there are so many stereo .
we can put together <unk> million different stereo together from the components that are offered in this business .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
in other areas , the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , you could have all the phone personnel that you wanted when you went by ma bell .
you rented your phone . you didn &apos;t buy it .
and one consequence of it was that the telephone was never broken .
those days are over .
we now have almost an infinite array of telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite one is halfway out in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and crème reconstructed .
and if you haven &apos;t seen this yet in your business , you can be sure you &apos;re going to get there soon .
and what it does is it makes people walk into the business and ask that question .
now , you know what the answer to that question ?
the answer is no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a cellphone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life , which are much more important than buying objects , the same explosion of choice meets choice .
health -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you get to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor says we could do a thing or we could do b .
a has the benefits and the risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do you want me to do ? &quot;
the doctor says a has these benefits and risks and b has the benefits and the risks .
what do they want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you &apos;re me , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy , &quot; which sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift of the burden of responsibility for the making of someone who knows something -- namely , the doctor -- to someone who knows nothing and most likely to be sick , and therefore not in the best constitution is to make a decision -- threat of the patient .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for prescription drugs for people like you and me , that if you think about it , you don &apos;t make any sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they advertise around us if we can &apos;t buy ?
and the answer is , you take the doctor to phone the next morning and ask for a change in the prescription .
something as profound as our identity is now a question of choice .
we don &apos;t inherit identity , we invent them .
and we invent as often new as we want .
that means every day you wake up the morning you have to decide what some type of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the united states was that almost everybody had one , and they got married as quickly as they could , and then they got children as quickly as they could .
the only real choice was &quot; who , not when , and not what they did afterwards .
nowadays , everything is easy to have .
i teach wonderful smart students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less clever , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re preoccupied with other things , they ask themselves , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i get married now ?
should i marry later ? should i have children or do a career ? &quot;
those are all well-meaning questions .
and you &apos;re going to answer those questions whether it means doing all the tasks that i &apos;m teaching you and not good grade in my course .
and in fact , they should . these are important to asking questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl explained , with the technology that allows us to work every minute of every place on the planet -- until the <unk> hotel .
and by the way , there &apos;s a corner i &apos;m not going to tell you about , which will work on the ground .
i won &apos;t tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is that incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of making decisions , over and over again , whether we should be working or not working .
we can look at our kids playing football , and we have our cell phone on that one hip , and our blackberry on other hip , and our laptop probably our lap .
and also , if you &apos;re all off , every minute in which we spend our child on the buses of a pandemic , we also ask ourselves , &quot; should i accept this call ?
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even as the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; it certainly appears to be your experience of your child &apos;s experience very different from it .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , tangible things and lifestyle , life is a matter of choice .
and the world we lived in looked like this .
i mean , there were some choices , but not all was a question of choice .
and the world we now live in now looks like this .
and the question is , are the good or bad news ?
and the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to do what bad about it .
all those choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
one effect , more obvious , is that it &apos;s getting weary rather than free .
with so many options you can choose , people are very hard to even choose .
i &apos;m going to give you another <unk> example of one study of investing in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to <unk> , the giant <unk> of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 percent leader offered the employer , taking trouble by two percent .
they offer 50 degrees of suicide -- 10 percent less employees than if they would offer five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 key machines who are choice , it &apos;s as hard to decide which to decide that they put it on tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , , of course , never comes .
now , understand that it &apos;s not just that people have to eat dog dog , when they &apos;re going to retire , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go in , it also means making decisions so hard they miss a lot of their employer .
by not participation , they &apos;re spending up to 5,000 u.s. dollars a year from the <unk> that would have been happy to reproduce their contributions .
paralysis is a result of many choices .
and i think it makes the case that the world looks like this .
they want to make the decision really right when it &apos;s for all eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to pick the false investment fund or even the fake investment .
so this is the effect . the other effect is that even if we can overcome paralysis and make a decision , we end up with less content with the outcome of choice , as if we had the opportunity to choose less from less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is determined by the great selection of different disciplines , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what &apos;s left is perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have made a different decision that would have been better . and what &apos;s happened is that these cultured options lead to the decision , and that regret seems negative to the happiness they made , even if it was good .
the more possibilities there are , the easier it is to regret , that is disappointing to the choices you make .
second , what economists call <unk> .
dan gilbert did a big point this morning by telling how much the way we evaluate things depends on what we compare .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternatives to think about , if there &apos;s a lot of alternatives to think about alternatives that exclude them , it makes them less content with the alternatives they voted .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what they should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple of the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great days . you have it all for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; &quot; damn ! &quot; he thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everyone in my <unk> neighborhood is gone .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
and he has followed two weeks of the thought that he &apos;s missed the possibility , day on day , to have a great parking lot .
<unk> reduces happiness , which we get through our choices , even if what we chose is fantastic .
and the more possibilities there are for choice , the more attractive characteristics of these choices are taking into account in terms of cancer .
here &apos;s another example .
now this cartoon makes a number of statements .
he makes a statement about living now and maybe doing things slowly .
but one of the most important things he does is , always who they choose to do , they don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things may have many attractive traits , and it &apos;s going to be what they &apos;re doing less attractive .
three , orders of expectations .
this struck me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time when there was only jeans of one species , and they bought them , and they got a bad job , they were incredibly portable , and if they had long enough and they &apos;d had long enough , they started to feel &quot; okay . &quot;
so , to buy new jeans , after many years of the age of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have some jeans , here &apos;s my height . &quot;
and the sales said , &quot; do you want rich , light , range ?
do you want to have the buttons or a half ?
do you want to have jeans with holes ?
you want to cut a way down , <unk> , blah , blah , &quot; and so on and on .
my jaw was down , and after i recovered , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like the way that the only species used to be . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour all of these bloody jeans , and kate the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best , perfect jeans i &apos;ve ever had .
i had better . all these choices made me get it better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it myself .
the reason i felt worse is because of all those available possibilities , my expectations for what was going on for a good pair of jeans .
i had very low expectations . i didn &apos;t have any extra expectations when there was only one in some way .
when they came in in 100 species , you know , one of them should have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i struck what i was going to expect , and what i had had in comparison with what i expected .
adding opportunities to the lives of human beings inevitably increase people &apos;s expectations on how well they &apos;re going to be .
and this leads to less satisfaction with results , even though the results are good .
nobody in the world knows this , because if they were , they don &apos;t know what it &apos;s all about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason that used to be better than anything worse was when everything was worse , it was possible for people to make experiences that had a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world that we live in -- we wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection , an expectation -- the best for which you can ever hope , is things as good as you expect it to .
they &apos;re never going to be pleasant because their expectations , my expectations , are big .
the secret to the <unk> -- which is what they &apos;ve all come for -- the secret to <unk> is low expectations .
i want to say -- a short ted moment -- that i am married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done better . i didn &apos;t interfere .
but plato is not always a bad thing to settle .
ultimately , a consequence of <unk> , if there is only one way to buy , is that when you &apos;re dissatisfied , and you ask yourself why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what could you have done ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they &apos;re one that is disappointing , and they ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is , you know .
they could have done better .
with 100 different species in the windows , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , when people make decisions , and even though the results of decisions are good , they feel frustrated about it , they &apos;re blaming themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i believe a graffiti -- not the only , but a whopping dispute on this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that human beings have learned that they have , because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain these experiences , it would be your fault .
and so the argument that we are in general better is objective , and we &apos;re feeling worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official dogma , the one that we all think is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that a choice is better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow that more choice is better than something .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;ve missed this dot for a long time where selection is improving our greater lives .
now , as an assumption -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a policy question about thinking about that , and what all of these choices allow in the developed communities is that material is wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of them whose problem is not too big choice .
their problem is they have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about are a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and tedious is , steve levitt told you yesterday about how this expensive and heavy car seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy that they don &apos;t help .
they actually hurts .
they &apos;re worried that we are bad there .
if some of the things that allow the people of our society to make so much decisions to those societies in which people had little choice , not just improve the lives of people , but our dignity will be improved .
economists call this a <unk> application .
needless to make sure that it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all of these great choices are dominated us .
finally , reading this cartoon , please , and a sophisticated person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know anything in this room . &quot;
impoverished imagination , a defensible view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i got to the point that the fish knows something .
because the truth is , if you break the <unk> , everything is possible , you have no freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break that down , everything is possible , bring it down happiness .
they increase paralysis and decrease happiness .
everybody needs an escape system .
this is almost confined to mike safety -- possibly for fish , definitely for us .
but the main being of a metaphorical motivator is a recipe for misery , and , i guess , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i talked about some of these projects before about the human genome and what that could mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , let &apos;s start from a new point : we have digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code into a new phase of biology by designing and building new life .
we always tried to ask major questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something i think many biologists have tried to understand and do at different levels .
and we tried different approaches to make the minimal components .
we have been digitized in nearly 20 years , when we sequenced the design code , shifting from the analog world of biology to the digital world of biology .
now we try to wonder , can we regenerate , or can we transform new life , from this digital universe ?
this is a map of a small organism , mycoplasma <unk> , who has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to do if we can do that with a even smaller genome .
we &apos;ve managed to get rid of about a hundred genes from 500 or so , which are here .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple in comparison to ours . trust me , it &apos;s simple . but if we look at all of these genes that we eliminate one after another , it &apos;s very unlikely that it would lead to a living cell .
and so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to actually synthesize this chromosome , which allows us to vary the individual components and ask some of the fundamental questions .
and so we started wondering , can we synthesize a chromosome ?
is it possible to make the chemistry that really large molecules have never been done before ?
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is actually just a piece of goofy chemical material .
our steps in the digitize life were exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has been evolving very slowly but is still increasing , and our final point is now going to go on an exponential curve .
we started 15 years ago with this .
it took us several years from now with a <unk> review before we did the first experiments .
it turns out that &apos;s a very difficult one .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s an ongoing process , so the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes you make .
so we had to develop a new method with which we could recombine these little pieces and correct the errors .
that was our first attempt , starting with digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it &apos;s a small virus of bacteria killing .
we made small pieces , made a correction error , and we had a dna that &apos;s about 5,000 letters .
the exciting stage was when we took this piece of fossilized chemical and put it into a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles came from the cells , and then came back and killed e. coli .
so i talked to the oil industry recently , and they said they understood this model exactly .
they laughed more than you do this .
so we think that this is a situation where we can actually build your hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted a lot to go . we wanted to build an entire sheet of chromosomes , and it has more than <unk> letters , so we thought , we &apos;re building it on the size of the virus that we could change the size of cassette strings to understand what the single components of a living cell are .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , that digital information must be really accurate .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the warning was in a 10,000 pair of base base base .
we found 30 mistakes . if we used the original sequence , it would have never been possible .
part of the design is to make pieces that are 50 letters long , and you have to overlap with other bits of design in order to make smaller plastic loads in order to fit these together .
we have unique elements built up here .
you may have heard that we have <unk> inside it .
think about it : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t .
there &apos;s about 20 amino acids in this letter -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , phrases , thoughts .
we started only signed .
some people were disappointed that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
we engineered the pieces so we could just take them out with enzymes , and there are enzymes that bring these repair and bringing them together .
and we started to make pieces , starting with pieces of the five to <unk> letters , they would put those together in order to make <unk> , to bring them together , up to <unk> .
in each step , we produced these pieces , so we could sequence them , because we were trying to create a very powerful process , which you &apos;ll see in a minute .
and we tried to get to the point where we &apos;re going .
so this looks like a woodpecker .
when we get to these really large pieces -- over 100,000 base pairs -- they don &apos;t just grow in e. coli . it &apos;s not going to grow in the e. coli , and so we applied to other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism called the ventral locomotor system that uses biology to repair dna that can bring together these pieces .
here &apos;s an example of this . there is an organism called <unk> <unk> that <unk> three million rads of radiation .
you can see in the upper field that his chromosome just drops apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything will merge as it was .
we have thousands of organisms who can do that .
these organisms can be completely parched , they can live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely certain that life exists in space and can move in the search for aquatic conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of these out there .
here &apos;s a data map of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using these processes -- in fact , we &apos;ve been using <unk> with the right design of the pieces , and then yeast does it automatically automatically .
this is not rocket locking , it &apos;s a regular woosh .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can actually see it with the <unk> .
this is footage over the span of six seconds .
that &apos;s the publication we &apos;ve just done recently .
this is over <unk> letters of genetic code , and it &apos;s the largest molecule that has ever been created by people .
it &apos;s over 300 million dollars .
if we put it on a scale of 10 and a half without a mass reduction , it would encompass vascular pages just to address this genetic code .
so how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
now obviously , it &apos;s a virus that &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s much harder to deal with bacteria .
it &apos;s also simpler when you &apos;re doing it in <unk> like you are : you just take the nucleus out and you give another in , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about cloning .
in <unk> , the chromosome is embedded in the cell , but it &apos;s only recently shown that you can actually transplant a chromosome from one cell to another and get it activate .
we &apos;ve cleaned the chromosome of a field of energy , roughly speaking , these two of them are just like humans and mice , and we put that chromosome on it , and we were able to destroy it with enzymes around all the proteins , and it was very amazing when we gave it to a cell -- and you &apos;re going to appreciate our very lofty graphs .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought this is the end , but we tried to bring the process a little bit .
that &apos;s the evolution of evolution here .
we &apos;re finding all sorts of species here that took a second chromosome or a third of <unk> , each time thousands of things in one second to a species .
so people who think of evolution as a gene changed a lot of biology .
there are enzymes called the restriction enzymes that are actually called dna .
the chromosome that has been in the cell has no one ; the chromosomes that we &apos;ve put in .
it was deposited in the cell and recognized the other chromosome as foreign material , and so we ended up with only one cell with a new chromosome .
it &apos;s blue because of the genes that we &apos;ve put in .
and after a very short period , it was lost all the characteristics of species , and converted completely into a new species based on the new software that we gave in the cell .
all proteins changed membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we went through .
it may sound genomic <unk> , but we can , by shifting the environment , change things quite dramatically .
now i &apos;ve argued that this is not the <unk> -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i argued that we may be doing a new form of cambrian explosion in which there might be massive new breakthroughs based on this digital design .
why should we be doing that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious to what we need .
we &apos;ve gone from four billion people to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context , i was born in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet have existed in 1946 ; within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , propellant for 6.5 billion people .
it will offer you a challenge for nine .
we need about five billion tons of coal , 3.1 billion barrels of oil . that &apos;s a hundred million drums a day .
if we think about biological processes , or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
and then , of course , all the co2 from this material goes on in the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries around the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want you to believe that those are the agents of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components , and look at the diversity that came out of it .
we &apos;re primarily representing the limits of biological reality and our imagination .
we have technologies today because of these rapidly <unk> to do what we call cultural genetics .
we now have the opportunity to build a large robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
and if you can imagine to make these 20 million genes , or to optimize these processes to produce environmental services , or medicine , we can change more molecular biology than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just quantum selection , and we can look at <unk> sounds , production of chemicals , or <unk> , and so on .
this is a shot from actual <unk> where we &apos;re actually going to sit down and create new species on the computer , smart design .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like , and we know exactly what the genetic code is going to look like .
now , let &apos;s focus on the fourth generation .
you &apos;ve seen corn on ethanol recently , which is a bad experiment .
we have benefited of the production and third generation that are relatively soon coming out , that are going to have much higher levels of energy , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
but , as we think , the only way we think of biology is going to have a huge impact on the cost of food , or the limitation of their availability , if we look at co2 as a source source , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that go this way .
and we think that we will be the fourth generation with the fourth generation , and it &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of ways .
this is one organism that we described in 1996 .
it lives in the deep sea , about 120,000 miles deep , with almost occasional <unk> .
it &apos;s turning co2 in methane to use hydrogen as a source of energy .
we &apos;re going to study whether we can use carbon dioxide , which could just be brought to <unk> , convert co2 to the fuel to drive this process .
within a short period of time , we believe we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really -- <unk> targets like the replacement of all the petrochemical car industry -- right . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where else ? a source of the energy will be .
but the same thing we &apos;re working on now is using the same approaches to developing vaccine vaccine .
you saw it with the flu this year ; we &apos;re always going back a year and have a dollar when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that &apos;s going to be changed by creating off-the-shelf vaccines in advance .
that &apos;s what the future might look like , can now be accelerate with changes today , with synthetic bacteria , hydrogen cells , and maybe <unk> .
we &apos;re light years from a lot of people . our goal is just that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that . thank you very much .
i handed up at the last ted conference an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works .
so here it is . and for those who weren &apos;t there at the time , the lhc is the biggest scientific experiment ever approached -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that existed less than a second second of the universe -- and it &apos;s up to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
we take pictures of these technologies in detectors .
this is what i work on . he &apos;s called an atlas detector -- 44 meters across the width , 22 feet across .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction that you see the scale .
on september 10th last year , the engine ran for the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
there were huge cabling in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first angle of dna that all the route around the lhc , then defined by one part of the lhc in order to make a chip on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture on september 10th , we knew that the machine works , which is a great victory .
i don &apos;t know if this created the largest <unk> , or this , when someone went to the google side and found the front page like this .
it means that we have a cultural impact against the scientific division .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wires .
these actually wires run juniper displays when the machine &apos;s running on the walls .
now , the engineers amongst you will look at them and say , &quot; no you don &apos;t . these are little wires . &quot;
they can do this because if you cool them down very far , they become what we call the so-called <unk> .
so at minus 5,000 degrees , cooler than the space between the stars , these wires can withstand that tension .
in one of the connections , between over 12,000 magnets in the lhc , there was a counter-trend .
so the wires get slightly lifted up and <unk> , and suddenly , electrical resistance .
this was the result .
now , this is even more amazing when you imagine that the magnet weigh over 20 tons and rise by about 30 inches .
so we doubled about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we did .
we redefined them , they overloaded it .
they &apos;re all back on their way back .
by the end of march , the lhc will be viable .
we &apos;re going to turn it on , and we &apos;ll be able to collect the data in june or july , and go ahead and find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , in a way , the debate is about the value of science and engineering on such boundaries . it &apos;s easy to reject it .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to reach beyond the limits is things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my third words with an english scientist . <unk> <unk> , who i suspect when he was defending the <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his apprentice was michael <unk> , and he said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human spirit , as accepting that our scientific beliefs stop , that there is no mysteries in nature that our <unk> are <unk> , and that there are no new worlds to conquer . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a novelist .
writing books is my profession , but of course it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , lifetime and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that ever to change .
however , recent is a little curious thing in my life and my career that has made me rethink my relationship with this work completely .
now , this curious event was that i recently wrote a book -- a biography called <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love , love -- that , unlike all of my previous books for some reason , they went out into the world and a big <unk> , international <unk> .
the result is , no matter where i come from , i &apos;m being treated to the fall .
seriously -- the fall of <unk> !
for example , you get to me totally concerned with me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re never going to have that success ?
don &apos;t you feel afraid that you <unk> your whole life and never again create a book that anyone in the world cares about ? never again ?
okay , that &apos;s really what &apos;s right .
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that , over 20 years ago , when i first told myself that i was going to be writer , i was confronted with the same kind of <unk> reaction .
and people said , &quot; don &apos;t you worry about having never succeeded ?
do you worry about killing somebody &apos;s humiliation ?
don &apos;t you worry that you will live in this craft for your life and never create something out of it , and that you &apos;re going to die on a <unk> dreams -- your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of failure ?
that &apos;s pretty much , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is : yes , yes .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all of these things .
and i &apos;d always had that .
and i was afraid many more things that nobody would see .
how algae -- and other things like that .
but i &apos;ve been thinking about writing for quite recently , and i ask myself , why ?
is that sensible ?
is it logical that someone should be expected to do the work of doing the work he &apos;s struggling with ?
and what &apos;s happening with the creative project is that they make us feel secure about the inner mental illness -- in a way that other jobs don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemist and i can &apos;t remember any situation in his 40 years as a chemist who was asked if he was afraid to be a chemist .
so with your <unk> , john -- how are you doing this ?
it just didn &apos;t occur , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists , over the centuries , have not received the call of <unk> <unk> people .
now , we writers seem to have this kind of reputation , but not only the writers , but the creative of all the genres , seem to have this reputation , mentally tremendously unstable .
all you have to do is look at the bitter <unk> of really great minds just from the 20th century , who have young and often died of their own hand .
and even those who are not properly neglected seemed to be really neglected from their own talent .
norman wertheim , just before his death in his last interview , said i had killed a little bit further than that in his last interview .
it &apos;s an extraordinary statement that they can do about their oeuvre .
but we &apos;re not even relieved when we hear somebody say something like this , because we &apos;ve seen this kind of statements for such a long time , and somehow we &apos;ve known this notion of suffering and collective , that creativity and suffering -- in the end , always leads to <unk> .
the question i want to ask everybody here is : is this an idea in order for you ?
do you feel about that ? because at the same time , at a distance -- i don &apos;t feel comfortable with that perception .
i found them more .
and i find them dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to watch it taken into the next century .
i think better if we &apos;re encouraging our great creative endeavors .
and i definitely know that for me -- in my situation , it &apos;s very dangerous to start , to start , this dark path of thought -- in particular , in the situation in which i &apos;m in my career right now .
that means -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 university clinic in me .
and it &apos;s extremely likely that what i &apos;m going to write from now is being judged by the world as the work that &apos;s been successful in my last book &apos;s success , right ?
i say yes , because we &apos;re all kind of friends -- it &apos;s very likely that my greatest achievement is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kinds of thoughts that can get someone to start at 9 o &apos;clock in the morning , to drink , and i don &apos;t want that .
i would keep going to keep doing this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some of the time , i feel that , in order to continue writing , i have to continue to write a kind of monolithic psychological construct .
in some way , i &apos;ve got to figure out a way to write a safely distance between me and my very natural sense of how the reaction will be on writing .
while i was looking for models over the last year , to do this , i &apos;ve been searching in the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if they might have better or psychological ideas about how to help creativity with the emotional risks associated with creativity .
this quest led to me in ancient greece and old rome .
please join me , because the circle will end again .
but in ancient greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from human beings , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of godly material that comes from a distant , unknown source to people -- from <unk> , unknown reasons .
the greeks named these divine <unk> of creativity &apos;s creativity demons .
now , from socrates , he &apos;s known to think he had thought he was telling wisdom from the distance .
the romans had the same idea , and the kind of creative creative mind was a genius genius .
that &apos;s great . the romans didn &apos;t really think that genius was a very clever individual .
they believed that genius was this kind of magical divine creatures that was believed that literally it lives in the walls of a <unk> -- something like <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> and the artist in the work of virtually invisible <unk> and the outcome of work .
that &apos;s brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s a distance i talked about -- the psychological construct that &apos;s protecting you from your work .
and everybody knew it worked like that , right ?
the artist &apos;s artist was protected with certain things , like , for example , too much annoying , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t do anything for you . everyone knew you had this terrified genius that helped you .
when your work fails -- not pure your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew your genius was a little bit of chicken .
so people in the west really thought about creativity in the west .
and then the renaissance came and changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual in the center of the universe -- all the gods and the mysteries , and there &apos;s no room for more mystical creatures taking orders from divinity .
it &apos;s the beginning of humanism , and people started to believe that creativity was completely from its individual individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people a genius , or they call them a genius -- instead of having a genius .
i have to tell you , i think it was a big mistake .
you know what ? i think one of the naked things that he thinks is that he thinks he or she is like the vessel , like the basin and the essence and the source of all divinity , creative , unknown , infinite mystery is a little bit too much responsibility for a <unk> , human psyche .
it &apos;s like asking somebody to swallow the sun .
the tenor and <unk> whole egos , and it creates all this idealistic expectations to success .
and i think this monstrosity has annihilated our artists in the last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true .
can we change it ?
perhaps to a ancient understanding about the relationship between people and the mystery of creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t eradicate this thought from 500 years of rational humanism in a <unk> talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience who would really register fair scientific doubt about the notion of -- basically -- <unk> that people , and apply people to do their projects , and so on .
i &apos;m not likely to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i ask is , why not ?
why not think that way ?
because it &apos;s as much sense as anything that i &apos;ve heard about when it comes to explaining the absolutely crazy <unk> of the creative process .
a process that , as any of you know , has ever tried to do something -- so in other words , everyone here is not always rational .
in fact , it can feel silly sometimes .
i recently met an encounter from the extraordinary american poet , who is now over 90 , but she was a whole course of poet , and she told me that when she was growing up at the <unk> virginia , she was working out in the fields , she said she would feel and hear as a poem about the landscape on her landscape .
she said it would be like a <unk> train .
which is what was going on on her land .
she felt when it came , because it would take the earth under your feet to the quake .
she knew she could only do one of those things in such a moment , and that was -- in her words , <unk> race like the devil .
and she ran the devil in the house as the devil was tracking by this poem , and it was the only point that she had to quickly get enough to a piece of paper and a pencil , so she could get it through it , and grab it through her .
in other words , she wasn &apos;t fast enough , they ran and ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t reach the house , and the poem would roll through them , and she missed it . she said it was going to move on land and -- as she said , after another poet , looking for a different poet .
and then there were these moments -- i &apos;ll never forget the part -- she said that there were times when they missed it .
so , she runs to the house , and she &apos;s looking for the paper , and the poem goes through her , and she &apos;s taking a pencil right through her , and then she &apos;s -- she said -- it was like she was going to reach with her other hand and get it .
they caught the poem on his tail and he pulled it back into her body and took over on the piece of paper .
in those opportunities , the poem came clean and intact on the paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first .
when i heard that , i thought this was really bizarre -- that &apos;s just how my creative process is occurring .
that &apos;s not at all like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a training student . i have to get up every day at the same time and sweat , romance and really awkward <unk> .
but even i have , in my book class , sometimes have scratching this thing .
and i guess many of you did as well .
even i had worked or ideas that make from a source through me , which i really cannot identify .
what is this thing ?
and how do we deal with that without losing our minds , but keeping ourselves on the opposite , even in intellectual health ?
for me , the best living example of how to do this is to interview tom , and i was allowed to interview him for a magazine a few years back .
we talked about this topic , and what ? most of his life was tom &apos;s embodiment for the embodiment of modern artist who was trying to master and deal with them .
but then he got older and quiet . he told me that he was driving on a freeway in los angeles , and then everything changed for him .
he was driving at high speed when he was suddenly hearing a little fragment of a piece , which , in inspiration often , is elusive to him , and he wants to do it . she &apos;s gorgeous , and he &apos;s gorgeous , but he can &apos;t tap it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he has no pencil , he doesn &apos;t have a shit .
so he starts to rise this old , old , old , sort of , like i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to be following this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not able to do it .
but instead of panicked , he just stopped .
he ended the board , did something completely new .
he just kind of looked into the sky and said , &quot; excuse me , can you see that i &apos;m driving a car ? can &apos;t you see that i &apos;m driving ?
in retrospect , i look as if i could just write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a <unk> moment , when i can take care of you .
if not , somebody else is doing it today .
go and <unk> leonard cohen .
his whole process process changed .
not the work itself . it was still as dark as ever .
but the process and the heavy <unk> that surrounds him was no longer when he took the genius out of it , where he didn &apos;t take anything out of trouble and then sort of put it into where he would come from . he realized that there was no final , <unk> thing to do .
there could be an extraordinary , wondrous , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the strange , physical thing that was not entirely tom .
as i heard this story , it has also changed the way i worked , and it saved me once .
this idea made me saving me when i was in the middle of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love , and i fell into one of these <unk> , where we all fall when we &apos;re working on something and didn &apos;t work . you start thinking it &apos;s going to be a disaster . that &apos;s the worst book ever written .
not just bad , but the worst of all times .
i started thinking , well i should just <unk> the project .
but then i remembered how tom had spoken in the wild sky , and i tried .
so i took my look at the manuscript and i talked to my comment towards an empty corner of the room .
i mentioned loud , you guys , you and i both know when this book is not brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see , i &apos;m going to invest everything i have . i don &apos;t have any more than that .
so if you want to have it better , you need to show it up and achieve your share of deal .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that ... you know what , the heck with it .
i &apos;m going to keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to ask to record that i was here today for my part of the jobs .
because ... well , at the end of it , it &apos;s like follows . centuries before centuries have come together in the deserts of <unk> people with holy dances and music , the long hours -- until dawn .
these fixed people were always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again and again , very rare , something special happened . one of the actors was actually <unk> .
and i know that you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen such a performance in your life .
it was as if the time rose and the dancers were walking through some art , and he did nothing different than ever before he ever did -- 1,000 nights before , but everything got together .
and all of a sudden , he couldn &apos;t be entirely human .
it was lit up from the inside , and it &apos;s lighting up from the bottom , and it all returned through a divine fire .
when something happened , people knew what it was . they called it his name .
they put the hands together , and they started singing : <unk> allah , allah , allah , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
what &apos;s interesting about this is that when the <unk> ceremony came to grips with this practice , they brought this practice , and over the centuries of the centuries of pulmonary allah , allah , allah , <unk> , they were still listening to <unk> and <unk> .
if an artist in spain did something impossible , something magical has done : <unk> allah , <unk> , <unk> , allah , that &apos;s fun ; it &apos;s a glimpse of god .
and that &apos;s great because we need it .
but , the tricky part is following the next morning when the dancers wakes up and realizes it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he &apos;s no longer an ambigram of god .
it &apos;s merely an aging <unk> with <unk> knees , and maybe it will never get back to these heights again .
and maybe again , somebody will ever call god &apos;s name when he &apos;s rotating , but what would he do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the scarcest reversal of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite as of , if you didn &apos;t believe in the beginning , that the extraordinary aspects of your existence came from you .
if you may just believe that you &apos;re a loan from a spectacular source of a <unk> time of your life that &apos;s passed on to somebody else when you &apos;re done with it .
when we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and so i think with safety in the past few months , while i was working on the book that will appear -- when dangerous , frightening , heavily <unk> successor of my name .
what i have to say to myself is , when i get crazy about this , i &apos;m not afraid .
don &apos;t shave .
just do your job .
keep your contribution on whatever it is that it may be .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the dumb divine genius that you &apos;re asked about , you decide , for a brief moment , to show a kind of wonder of wonder through your effort , <unk> <unk> ! <unk> !
and if not , dance still dance .
and <unk> beaucoup , despite all this .
i believe in this , and i feel that we should teach that .
<unk> bellos ! <unk> for all of this , simply for being the mere human love and the <unk> to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
yay !
last year , i showed the two slides to illustrate that the arctic <unk> , which had declined for nearly three million years to have decreased the size of the lower 48 states .
but this doesn &apos;t push enough to the seriousness of this particular problem , because it shows not the thickness of ice .
in a way , the arctic sea is the beating heart of our global fusion .
it grows in winter and summer in summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a record of what happened over the last 25 years .
there &apos;s a red marker with red .
as you can see , it &apos;s highlighted on the dark side , this is the annual ice ice in winter , and it &apos;s exploding in summer .
the so-called <unk> , five years old , or older , is almost like blood , which is out of the body here .
it &apos;s been gone in 25 years from here .
this is a problem because warming is the dominant reason around the arctic ocean , where there &apos;s large amounts of carbon dioxide , which , when it floats , is made by microbes to methane .
compared to the entire amount of oily material in the atmosphere , it could double that amount if we cross this critical point .
already today in some flat lakes in alaska , methane is methane from the water .
a professor , professor , walter walter at the university of alaska , went to another top force to another top lake last winter .
wow !
you &apos;re good . the question is , how will we conceivably .
and one reason is that this enormous sony heats up greenland .
this is a a year of poppies .
but the volume is far bigger than ever before .
this is the euphore river in the southwest greenland .
if you want to know how the sea level , sea level , is flowing into the sea .
these rivers are getting very rapid .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest entry on the planet .
now , last month , researchers reported that the entire continent has now an injury .
and the bombsights that showed up a couple of different magicians is particularly heavily melting .
this is 20 feet across , like greenland .
in the himalayas , in the most <unk> , you see there are new lakes that were just a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their neighborhood out of that pool .
in the andes , this glacier is the phonogram for this city .
the tasmanians have been expanded .
but if you squeeze along , most of the drinking water is also discarded .
in california , a 40 percent reduction reduction in the sierra sierra camps .
this is the complication .
and the predictions as you read it are serious .
so these if-then communities around the world make a dramatic increase in fire .
and the disasters around the world have actually gained an unprecedented extent , never an unprecedented extent .
four and so many have been 75 in the tens of 30 years .
this is a perfectly <unk> photograph .
if you look at this in a historical context , you can see what it is doing .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve produced 70 million tons of co2 all 24 hours -- 25 million tons a day into the oceans .
look at the region of the east pacific right now , the american continent west and both sides of indian reserve , where there &apos;s a significant decline of oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest single factor for global warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most frequent biggest problem .
the united states is one of the two major economies , combined with china .
and the suggestion was to build a lot of other projects .
but we &apos;re starting to see change .
here are the ones taken out over the last few years with some green alternatives suggested .
there is a political dispute in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have spent a 265 dollars of last time spent in order to promote clean coal , which is already a contradiction in itself .
this image reminded me of something .
and after christmas , sitting in tennessee , at home in tennessee , a billion tons of vacuuming .
you saw it in the news .
this is in our entire country &apos;s native american country .
this was after christmas .
one of the commercials of the <unk> after christmas was this .
<unk> is a six-day happy kid .
it &apos;s in shell and abundance in america , and it &apos;s helping our economy grow .
<unk> , the <unk> gets cleaner every day .
it &apos;s affordable and graceful , and workers remain in housing and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
most powerful <unk> is the head of <unk> coal .
let me just say one clearly , al gore , nancy <unk> , harry bottles , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate change has been established in life .
this is one , a part of it .
in retrospect , we see climate change as a serious threat to our business .
so that &apos;s why we set it up to the supreme court system , and we spend a significant online study on the road to get the truth on charcoal .
the fact is that coal is not messy .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and also smells good as well .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
let &apos;s do that quietly .
<unk> coal , they &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean adhesive .
fantastic ! this machine is very noisy .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean water shield .
and yet the burning of coal is one of the main reasons that global warming is global warming , the remarkable clean data that you see here changes everything .
if you look carefully , this is the one that &apos;s , you know , clean water technology .
finally , the positive alternative to our economic challenge and our challenge for national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security crisis , the climate crisis .
so the red thread that connects them is our dependence on <unk> fuel like dirty coal and recyclable oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to get us out of this dynamic situation .
we have 100 percent clean electricity in the next 10 years .
a plan to get america back to work , make us safer and help stop global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
canadian america . find more out .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s about a distribution of america .
so one of the ways , our dependence in old , filthy fuels , confronting our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to create good investment .
<unk> america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african proverb : &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to come far , together . &quot;
we have to go far and fast .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to start by asking you for your childhood when you were playing with <unk> .
and as she realized how to reach out the hands and drag out , and then they actually learned how to think and understand the problems between understanding and understanding spatial connections .
spatial thinking is deeply linked to how we understand most of our environment .
as computer scientist -- inspired by the nature of our interaction with real objects , with my <unk> <unk> and my colleagues , i began to wonder , what if we could use computers that would move out like a digital finger on a flat surface -- what if we could intervene with both hands and take data in physical ways , and we could distribute it as we want it ?
and that question was so linked to us to explore the answer and evolved to the answer .
in short , a network is a interactive computer to the size of a czar .
you can be touched by your hand , you can see each other , you can detect your movements , and you have a screen and a timer .
more importantly , are physically , why you can only move them through the reach of hands and access .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation from exclusive to applying digital digital data .
and when these tools are becoming physical , and they develop awareness for their movements , to recognize each other and see the intricacies of ours with them , we can start to explore new and delightful insight .
i start with a few simple examples .
this layer of leather is for <unk> , and when i get it in a direction , the video will play forward , and when i get it in the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards .
and those interactive portraits are each other .
so if i put them side-by-side , that will make their interest .
when they are surrounded up , they &apos;ll notice that , and they can get a little nervous .
and they also feel their motions and their propensity .
so an interesting consequence of the interactions we started to recognize was that we could apply everyday gestures on data , like colors , how to do this with liquids .
in this case , we have three oxygen suits , and i can use them to pour paint in the middle , where they will mix .
if we exaggerate it , we can zoom in a little bit .
there &apos;s also some happy opportunities in education as languages , math or <unk> , where we give people the possibility of fast trial and want to see the results instantly .
so here i am -- this is a fibonacci series i &apos;m designing with a simple , simple puzzle .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of iconoclasm and <unk> .
basically you &apos;re going to get any round of all the <unk> letters every time , and as you &apos;re trying to make words , they &apos;re tested by a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , it &apos;s mixed , and you &apos;ve got new sensory strategies and new opportunities .
thank you .
these are some of the kids on a trip to the media lab . i could move them to try and make a video .
they really loved it .
one interesting thing about this kind of applications is you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is , &quot; blocks words , &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
so here &apos;s some of the people testing it .
that &apos;s our recent <unk> there on the lower right .
it turns out he only wanted to stack up the production chain .
so for him , they were just <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a health care program .
that &apos;s highlighted .
he can put new characters into the scene by installing the <unk> from the table that shows this character .
here he is leading the sun up .
the sun goes up to the end of the sun .
now he &apos;s turning a tractor in the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yes !
by shaking the <unk> , and by side-by-side , he can make the characters interact ...
... his personal story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with an open end , and it can decide how it evolves .
flying cat .
the last example , for which i have time to show you , is a field of light technology that we &apos;ve developed recently , and in the recycling room as sounds like <unk> , bass and drums .
each has four different variations ; you can select which one wants to be used .
and you can put those sounds into the sequence , which you can put in any particular pattern .
and you put them in by simply holding a dent on a two-wheeler .
and there are effects that you can change live like hall and filters .
you hook it down to a particular note and then it tends to enlist it .
and then larger effects like speed and volume that are used in the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we &apos;re starting to start putting the <unk> in two <unk> , and we &apos;re putting them in a row , and adding them and adding a little more voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do a little bit of drums doing that .
and now i hook the filter on the drums , so i can drive the effect live .
i can accelerate the entire sequence as i go up in one direction or another .
and now i combine the filters to the bass , for a little bit more expression .
i can change the sequence as it passes .
and by doing this , i don &apos;t have to plan them back in advance , but can improvise ; they can extend or speed them .
and finally , i can outsource the entire sequence by running the <unk> left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my desire to develop new pieces of technology that will fit the way our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to show you some of the new <unk> and some of the ways that we work in our lab .
the idea that i &apos;d like to leave you with is that we are at the verge of this new generation of tools with digital media that bring information into our world that is equal to our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking forward to all of you .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;m very happy to be there .
yeah , so what should be adventurous ?
i have to do a little bit of it , and it &apos;s really busy working with modern molecular biology .
i &apos;m studying molecular biology and research for a few years now , and that &apos;s what i started doing because i just wanted to know , and i wanted to do it in front of myself , which i learned in my study of studying .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter , like that .
i think that molecular biology now , in general , talked about , biotech , everything you matter about synthetic biology and so forth .
most importantly , it &apos;s extremely important and much more , much more important will be in the future .
there are so controversial things like these all genetically engineered plants on the walls .
there &apos;s now craig venter actually trying to make <unk> , which is fuel from algae .
there &apos;s also a little bit of things that are totally in your everyday life , which most people are not aware of but not consciously , for example , for example , that allow us to wash at 40 degrees laundry , are also conductive enzymes .
and you can continue the list endlessly .
and so from interested in this technology , i &apos;m further ahead of that one .
so why is it hacking ?
most of the people know this from the chunnel .
the computer is hacking , and it &apos;s always going to be the case in the media , yes , the hackers will break out somewhere and claws and so on .
that &apos;s kind of a very sad thing to do , because that &apos;s not what it actually started like , and what &apos;s actually behind it .
and that is , in the 1970s , in the 1970s , in the 1970s , started with <unk> , and that &apos;s where the internet came from .
and it &apos;s about solving some playful , creative , original ways , a problem .
and the problem is that it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can be just a little bit of a social problem , which is , you know , just a random question , a question , and how do you do it differently , or how do you make it better .
and it &apos;s just been used with software , but there &apos;s also a <unk> , there &apos;s a whole bunch of data that has been doing all kinds of different kinds of stuff .
and now , just in a way , in perspective , and there &apos;s this metaphor that comes out of synthetic biology , that biology is actually a key code , because , you know , the <unk> code is a complicated code , which is , it &apos;s not quite like computers , because it &apos;s dynamic , because it &apos;s matter , it &apos;s real matter , and it &apos;s not just <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can program it , so you can also hack it , like that , and that &apos;s what i found incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper .
this didn &apos;t really take wild eight , really , eight really , really , really .
there are <unk> columns , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe and with a cooperation in india , which is now members or active people all over the world now .
these are the more artistic frameworks , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and collaboration with scientists dealing with these technologies , thinking about these kinds of technologies and trying to process that creative , where there &apos;s <unk> , and yes , all kinds of things .
but it &apos;s really always about finding such a bespoke access to having a playful struggle with it .
and then there are <unk> columns , india-pakistan .
this is a network , which is actually more of the kind of forum where you can imagine where you &apos;re talking and discuss online .
they &apos;re kind of wrapped up a bit more technical , and they &apos;re a little bit more sophisticated , and then they get asked , you know , getting questions .
and from the networks of these networks that have all been popular , this is a scene that i just wanted to use for a second .
here &apos;s a picture on the left right here , which is a <unk> , so basically a school , like a private school , a nonprofit charity , a professional institution where everybody can get .
kids , old , all kinds of people getting there just to make a difference with it , they set up a lab and look at what can be done when these extremophiles are happening .
here &apos;s a group in indonesia on the left , which is called a group in indonesia , and it &apos;s a long time .
just more than those other two networks .
it &apos;s also in an artistic aspect of artistic materials , and , yes , <unk> , and combine that in a sort of <unk> way .
a group of ankara , who i met a little while ago , who have a little bit of time to convey the public , what they learn in college , and they &apos;ve been doing so on so small actions and trying to explain people to what &apos;s wrong .
and i &apos;ve got a lecture in copenhagen in the medical museum in the medical museum with an exhibit in combination with an exhibition .
and that is , yes , mostly young people , but the only thing that really does all of them is that fascination with the technology .
and what can you do and just focus on society on it and say , well , ok , what do you want , what do you want to participate with , have your interest in bringing you to this ?
so , okay , now to hack biology , you kind of need some material .
you need biological materials , and you need tools too , and that &apos;s a laboratory .
or what you normally understand under the lab , these are sort of <unk> machines , extremely expensive , extremely distant , only for <unk> , trained academic , and so on .
and our approach was just to say , okay , you don &apos;t really need to do that .
in fact , this is not necessary because every one of the people has actually developed even more sophisticated technology than most people , that really is .
and then with this premise with this premise with this premise , for example , brian <unk> in england is trying to put together a <unk> , and then , for instance , he took a <unk> , a <unk> and , yes , so on , and then they started to form bacteria .
so everyone that has a soup of soup that has been left for too long has been done before .
and i tried this in my lab at home , setting a little bit on ebay , and then i went on to buy on ebay and made a little bit of a <unk> analysis , tried to make a paternity test , so that night , at home .
actually , this shouldn &apos;t be a joke .
so at the bottom of this picture , you can see the lab , in <unk> , so there &apos;s such a <unk> garage with everything that &apos;s been done in university , a group in paris that has sort of set up what was going on , and quite a very interesting stuff , i &apos;m going to give you a project here for a second .
and this is <unk> , which also mentioned <unk> , this one , which is sort of a <unk> for molecular biology .
and yeah , you see , it &apos;s relatively <unk> , so there are people who are doing it by their own home , all the way down to large corporations , which are just going to have more <unk> in the form already .
but always , the approach is that it should just stop and be accessible .
the first project that we &apos;ve been doing as an international group of people , as we &apos;ve become aware of ourselves , okay , now that we have the real scene here , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people who are talking about it and all that .
and then it came from the <unk> <unk> website of the founder , and said , okay , we &apos;ve got to actually meet ourselves now , make real real , and then organized two events , one in london , 10 and a half to it in the <unk> , in san francisco .
and then , there it was , you know , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to share ?
and what are our values , what are our values , what is our purpose , our basis ?
and we &apos;ve worked out a bit of the world we have .
that was quite intuitive , so everyone just has this wishes , his , and what &apos;s going to move it down , you know .
and it came , in my opinion , a perfectly good code .
and then we didn &apos;t fix that , but that &apos;s probably , i think , has taken quite well , people are quite convinced by this .
and we even tried to bring it back to the academic world , but it &apos;s not there somehow .
so , i think , from online education , we &apos;re actually a step further than the world academic world .
so what do we do for projects like this ?
and one of the things that i did in switzerland was in switzerland , was that we wanted to build something called optical or optical plutocracy .
this is , if you just focus a laser laser , in one room , then you can catch little particles in the air , or in the liquid , and then move in the liquid and then move in that focus , so that &apos;s kind of the way it &apos;s just like this , basically .
it &apos;s really , it &apos;s done in academia , and we thought , okay , we might have , you know , we &apos;ve taken a webcam , the <unk> , the lens surface , then you have a microscope that &apos;s <unk> around , you have a microscope that &apos;s kind of <unk> .
you see that down there .
and then we got a <unk> torch <unk> and got rid of the laser out , and then focus on this camera .
and unfortunately , it didn &apos;t work out , but we still learned a lot about it .
so another project that comes from the french group in paris worked out that &apos;s pretty cool .
and in fact , he &apos;s got one of these things , such as a <unk> , so <unk> or something like that , so he &apos;s engaged with him , his great-granddad is sam marrocco .
he then set up this helmet and built it in cooperation with the museum .
and then the visitors could go in the room , sit on this chair , put this helmet in .
and then you measured your brainwaves , and depending on what you thought you thought , or you &apos;ve thought , is that you &apos;ve looked at different lights in the space .
it was quite a nice project .
another thing out of the united states , which has just to do with this <unk> , is the <unk> , which is pcr , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying just genes , replicating , adding fragments , fragments so that you can see it visible .
so now , if i do this to the <unk> at the scene of the crime , then they go to collect any sort of pollen , and then they &apos;re going to make these approaches , and then they can say , okay , this hair belongs to this man .
and the machines that make this kind of stuff , they &apos;re pretty much expensive to buy commercial , the cheapest they don &apos;t go to at mach 1 .
and that &apos;s not a fair technology , but it &apos;s a really cool technology , which also does a lot .
so this is just a use of many that can be done with this .
and they have , in fact , two of these builders , and they said , okay , we &apos;re making it easier and cheaper , and then we &apos;re going to have the open source , so an available hardware , <unk> , this device , and now they &apos;ve got that , and now they &apos;re actually the cheapest constraints of these devices around the world .
i think some hundred hundred dollars or something like that .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it certainly is in a frame where it &apos;s really available .
so , in my opinion , it &apos;s a very <unk> hack .
a project i started to build the other other recently was to build a jewelry project .
<unk> is , yes , like some kind of starbucks , they shoot about this so far , two centimeters or whatever .
you pour creases on <unk> , and then you put it into these <unk> , and then i &apos;d shoot them on onions and then have them light with it .
so the device that you see here doesn &apos;t work .
but that &apos;s my prototype , which has looked pretty wild , like in a branch , the thing on it , electronics on it and pressure , and that was the pressure that was too high , that thing was broken .
and then i took a junkie and put it in .
if you &apos;re a full of power with water , you have enough pressure , so i think it &apos;s 40 to <unk> cash .
and with that , you can accelerate the particles heavily enough , and then you go in the onion .
and the commercial device costs about 450 euros upward or something , something like 50 or so .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasible .
so , right now , the core point of the scene is to increase this availability of technology , and also to increase the information and increase that more people can engage .
because , as in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have pretty little sense of it , and also no way of making it really well .
because , if you just read about it , you know , it &apos;s not the same as if you did it yourself or you &apos;ve seen it .
and i think technology will always become more important in our modern societies .
and if you can , as a informed citizen , want to be able to make meaningful decisions in society and join them , then you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it and understand how to make it and understand it .
and then it &apos;s under the <unk> open and citizen science .
so that , as citizens , you &apos;re being copied as a citizens , looking at these scientific technologies .
and that &apos;s the core core of the <unk> .
these are the people who at least mastered at least on the website , <unk> website .
it &apos;s already a remarkable number of people worldwide .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;re represented in southeast asia .
that &apos;s i think there are fewer people there than actually exist .
so i know some of you who haven &apos;t leaked themselves .
and these are just the mystic , the individual people .
and in part , in part , these <unk> , they put it in these places .
and that &apos;s at the very beginning .
it started , as i said , just started .
and <unk> , which is the <unk> , because the <unk> in berlin was the first to <unk> .
and this is now a gigantic network of very good , yes , <unk> that are represented all over the world .
and we hope , of course , that we &apos;ll take a little bit closer than that , and then also be equally connected , so that even more people can get involved in it .
and i would invite everybody to look at it and do something for them .
it &apos;s not that simple now , but it &apos;s not impossible if you stick enough curiosity and stick enough energy , then you also get far .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yeah .
how do we work people ?
that &apos;s a question that is very moving to me as a designer , but also in the context of the <unk> and in front of all the things in the world user .
and it &apos;s about how you meet people in interactive media so they can use this interactive media and create them a much more satisfying experience .
in fact , i believe that interactive media in us are <unk> , cognitive models , which have been programmed in our biological memory , very long time , and that we just can restore that through interactive media just through interactive media .
and that &apos;s quite astonishing , because actually , you know that these <unk> , that you get there , that you actually get into the future , but in fact , it is that the future is right in us , in our pleistocene roots .
so what are conceptual models ?
i just wrote down four cylinders and i want to explain that for a second .
it &apos;s the models that we have in the pre-industrial times that we have in the pre-industrial times .
to study these well-known models , we &apos;ve heard basically natural relationship to virtuality .
that sounds like basically an unusual thing .
but i &apos;m going to go back in the same way , and i &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re also a natural relationship to virtuality .
the second thing is , because of these fossil models , we &apos;ve been able to speak very , very distinctive , even though we &apos;re using a robotic language today .
and the third area , which actually explains itself .
we all know that the interactive media is by definition , which includes the urgency of the linearity , and what gives us , of course , is that we now feel the linearity as normal .
the fourth thing is that the history for us is a place for us .
now , what about the virtuality , which is really the most natural thing in the world .
i want to prove to you about this .
how many doors has the house in which they live ?
we &apos;re not going to answer it to you immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s happening right now .
they go in the spirit through this house , in <unk> , and they &apos;re looking at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s exactly what they &apos;re doing .
it <unk> reality , and it has no computers .
fantastic , right ?
and so , for example , we &apos;re supposed to be spending the virtual reality of the virtual reality in our decision-making process , we actually can do that all the time .
and that sort of wealth the virtual reality of the reality , the people in the pre-industrial times needed bitter , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have any books .
or they didn &apos;t have any guns .
they had no mass mass .
the only thing that they had was their head .
and in that head , the memory was playing .
in this head , knowledge has been reviewed and through this virtual imagery , the imagination , has been passed on .
and so it &apos;s also so strong in us that we can deal with virtuality so well .
and the interesting thing about this is , if i can take a little trip here .
yeah , it goes .
and the interesting thing is , at that time , the human at the same time was <unk> and medium .
if you just keep thinking a little bit further .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that it has a change .
but i &apos;ll get to that in a minute .
the main tool of chaos has always been the story .
<unk> , preacher , so-called <unk> , were explicitly charged to preserve knowledge in stories .
and we &apos;re still very , very strong in stories today .
the author of the second author , jonathan <unk> , , according to the author of the book , is still four and a half hours a year of tales of stories .
that means for a child who has spent most of his life hanging out of stories most of his life .
now we think our love with stories depends on us sitting on the lap of our parents .
no , no , no .
this goes back much further , into the cultures of the pre-industrial times .
but for me , in the realm of interactive media as a particularly impressive fact , we &apos;ve focused as flute people in our biological memory , the ability to think more deeply .
i brought you with an example from the north indian tribe tribe .
and life lived in the throes of british columbia .
and as you can see , it &apos;s a very <unk> area , and you had to sort of mess from an island to island to get food .
and they did it with so-called <unk> .
you may know that , if you &apos;re interested in doing that , from the australian american american .
these have similar principles .
they have no malevolence , they have the so-called <unk> sensors that they use or also they have .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be mapped by songs .
the language of language was the head of <unk> &apos;s stature .
that means you &apos;re wiggling the sound and rhythm .
and that sound and that rhythm created the geology , the topography of an area , and that , of course , enabled you to break these songs and come together and come together and go to the left , to the right , to be able to move back to the right side .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to get from the top to a to b ?
anyway , to navigate .
so what happened actually ?
this is the age of machine age .
we &apos;ve been moving in so-called <unk> .
the machine age is happening and has happened , and that &apos;s what happened , and that &apos;s what happened .
and that &apos;s what happens is that we kind of shifted the responsibility for our memories and the production of our individual memories on external media .
on the book and in the picture .
so , unfortunately , we &apos;ve got god &apos;s play a little bit forgotten .
in virtuality , alien to us has become alien to us , and has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a famous cartoonist on the <unk> , is so far to say that this mass mass , he means the book and the picture , so not the television , the internet and so on , what we call the mass mass today that this mass mass has fossilized our memories , and our ability to have evolved .
let &apos;s make a little pause .
from the beginning to the machine machine .
what does influence in our thinking and our mind system ?
then they are the most salient of the pre-industrial civilizations .
and these are going to be more and more <unk> over the centuries of centuries and more of the influences in the world .
that is , instead of remembering us , we have standardized , widespread , massive patterns of memories that we can depend on our personal memories .
we are no longer producing ourselves .
we have an abstract language of language .
we don &apos;t imagine the thing more in pictures that aren &apos;t going to be in images anymore , but we make it our language .
we have used to things in linear .
and we accepted the linearity as a law , and there are only exceptions for example , for example .
what &apos;s left us is listening to life .
still , we &apos;re very , very arrested as a handout , being very , very arrested .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
we had the worst <unk> , we had the christmas age , and we &apos;re now going to take what we call the so-called bee machine .
this sounds very profound , and it sounds very <unk> , i know .
but these concepts of <unk> , they bring us all these possibilities back to our capacities .
there &apos;s virtuality about virtuality , it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about disillusionment .
i want to explain a little bit about this for a second .
there are technical concepts like augmented reality , which is the augmented reality .
so if you look at google <unk> for example , then this is a concept that will allow us to combine the virtual world with the real world , that means our affinity to the <unk> , to feel virtual as a normal , natural one , will be addressed again .
another example is that so-called virtual reality .
now , as crazy as this may sound in the context of my talk , that &apos;s where we move physically in an existing system , virtual worlds , based on the model of the content model .
and another example is the most basic , intelligent systems .
these are spaces that can react intelligent to one human .
all of this needs the ability to accept virtuality as a real living habitat .
i graduated in , and i hope that the video is going to bring a very , very nice project , and that &apos;s a gorgeous , very beautiful project , and i &apos;m hoping that this is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
and the two countries here are also here today .
you may be able to stand up for a second , so you can pause in the break with the two .
and i brought in this project as an example , as again as again , being addressed in this apocalyptic , cognitive models .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say to that .
of course , what &apos;s extremely <unk> , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say computer games , you &apos;re very likely to see that there are any people in front of you in front of you , or having to play with somebody in your hand .
anyway , they &apos;re in there .
this is a game for outside .
and that is to think that i discover the outside world , so that i discover the real world again .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data that we create with the real world .
i apologize that i have to resurrect so much .
and you can explain that in a much better way , there &apos;s more than that .
and the point is that i discover a city by looking at which places are positive or negative .
and so i get from the city a very different picture , a very different impression , which is that i see negatives and positive zones of a city , and quite a very different , virtual map of a very real city .
and we can now just look at that for a graph .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little explanation from what you &apos;re looking at .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , right ?
and with a kind of flashlight , we can see these virtual worlds visible .
so , i &apos;d like to wrap it up to my talk , and in the sense that the qualities and the skills that we have acquired out of the <unk> , and who have acquired us a little bit of a time in the age of the machine , that with the help of what we call the so-called <unk> , we can be turned back to the future , and that we &apos;re in this way about complex , technological , new products in the future , but actually coming back to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m really excited to be with you .
i &apos;ve just been asked if this bag is a <unk> bag , and i &apos;m going to talk to you instead .
he &apos;s not going to do that .
i &apos;ll sort of dissolve what &apos;s in there .
but so far i &apos;m going to do it just sort of curious .
yes , kids are naturally curious or should be curious , designers too .
i &apos;m a master designer , so i &apos;m also , of course , to the curiosity of curiosity , and how do the curiosity change our thinking again , and why do we also lose curiosity and have to get back and forth again and so on .
this is a whole series of things that you feel about as a designer &apos;s real existence .
when professors are curious , they &apos;re often going to be in the n <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been doing in the last half year .
a sandbox for natural user interface design .
now , you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why are the whole designers that are starting to deal with this natural , extracting system of communication , interaction and so on .
and i &apos;m just holding one of these small devices because things are supposed to be more intuitive , more and more natural , and you have to look at it , which is , of course , to people , of course , what is <unk> or intuitively .
and in front of the background , i &apos;m in the realm of natural user design , which is the next generation in dealing with human computers in the human relationship with the human computer , how our tools , or how computers might change from computers to become the digital assistant .
so i started doing this , which is , of course , or intuitively .
maybe let &apos;s look at it again .
why does this even happen ?
so , if we just look at the development of our society , here &apos;s a little plot , we move from the third side to the fourth , or we &apos;re moving forward .
so from modern to <unk> .
every society is shaped by a toenail .
initially , it &apos;s caused by language .
that means that you have spoken a shared language , you could communicate with each other , you &apos;ve moved into the same cave , or you &apos;ve got to other areas , you &apos;ve got cities , you &apos;ve got these villages , and you kind of created a child &apos;s way .
the <unk> was the language , something very natural , something very natural .
you had to learn as well , so no toddler can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning , of course , in absence of nature .
and that has been pressed by ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
this was a <unk> , because , of course , the living language started to manifest itself in the form of writing , which is what &apos;s left and alive , and i go and i put it in stone , and i &apos;m doing it too .
depending on how i beat and when i leave , of course , it &apos;s a very different narrative than when there &apos;s a life alive .
but then <unk> just moved this script as a <unk> , got started .
then came the next generation we &apos;re actually living in today .
it &apos;s just the printing and print background with gutenberg and others .
in the back of that , it &apos;s just as <unk> , where shortcuts , <unk> and others have said , are you really crazy when the people start reading , then they want to join , and that &apos;s completely fatal .
and now we get to the next generation and the exciting one , such a business project is just a few hundred years , and we are right now in this phenomenal phase of this phenomenal phase that we &apos;re doing that .
of course , we &apos;re completely confused by seeing the new media , social social media , facebook and so on .
with total transparency , which is the new idea , what the new thinking is , what the old thinking fails , doesn &apos;t tell you that in the most competitive , and no beef is more or other phenomena , that &apos;s what i just want to do right now , and just want to <unk> it .
and the two worlds just pop together , new and old thinking .
and the exciting thing is , if you look at the movie , this new society , this <unk> , very many mechanisms , principles and <unk> paradigm , is coming out of the atmosphere .
now not anymore at the local level , but on a global scale .
we &apos;ve understood that the weather is global .
that the theme of ecology is global .
it &apos;s not that if i think of local environmental and neighbor less ecologically , it doesn &apos;t work .
that is , from local village , a global village has become a global village with the same principles , as of course , in a very intuitive way , but total transparency .
as you knew in the village then , who &apos;s got something about who and when , this is what this expansion of this expansion of our self is doing on the global scale .
it is that we know that we have knowledge and we have more and more and more and more and more and better and bigger .
just as it used to happen in the village .
before the background , i was just busy looking at what &apos;s actually going on , which is that , of course , what we may have forgotten , which is , for us , what we may also have forgotten , so what &apos;s the difference ?
because often people get , they can &apos;t make it <unk> so they can avoid it .
so you have to deal with it , which is , and not just make it change , it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s also going to be better .
and when , of course , something intuitive and how can i take care of it as designers , and just look at things so that they &apos;re a <unk> , so they &apos;re intuitive , because they &apos;re fun and they &apos;re easy to use .
you know , you &apos;re kind of engaged on the perception of perception , with the subject of perception .
and that &apos;s , of course , to where you start and go and say , okay , now i &apos;m just looking into the inner self .
and what &apos;s it actually like in that ?
so how do we work when we get there ?
and because of course , what really does , and how do our channels function in perception , and how does the cognitive processing work ?
because steve jobs used to say you guys to dig them home to dig out to youtube &apos;s ass .
so you really have to look in detail when i want to make something odd or intuitively <unk> , meaning that in the core .
and you can see that a bit of our seven senses , which is most of us think we have only five , now it &apos;s even seven accepted , there &apos;s certainly seven accepted , and there &apos;s certainly the next , eighth sense , and , again , an expansion of ourselves .
and how do we process information , how do we process information ?
by the time , what &apos;s information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
a lot of people use the word , but they don &apos;t even know what it means .
but i have to understand in the core , understanding the character , when becomes information from data , when data is from data , and from information , i know i know how i can make things , later , intuitively , or , of course , <unk> .
and of course , design affects perception .
we see this when i &apos;m designing things , i can make them confusing , like on the right , where i don &apos;t know , which is salt and pepper , or i can make them intuitively intuitively by showing things .
so much natural , it &apos;s in a pot , but i &apos;m sort of looking straight where &apos;s salt and pepper .
and when i say somebody , give me salt or pepper , it will take you closer to the right , where is in there .
and so , very intuitive access to the left , and then hopefully , i hope not to have sugar in it , just give you the salt .
but also , our perception of ourselves , how fake them .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks more than the little , even though that &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re equally equally the same , and yet , our perception , depending on which way we push things together .
does anybody know what that is ?
microscopy on .
<unk> <unk> was still working .
it &apos;s pretty much like my favorite glasses there .
so , it &apos;s the n circle .
a second circle begins to facilitate or associate some resemblance .
and then , if i zoom in , again , we don &apos;t have one more unit , which is a circle , a circle , and yet we see a unit , we don &apos;t see three pieces , a circle , a circle , another one .
that &apos;s called <unk> , or <unk> , which also affects us in perception .
what &apos;s important for designers , they typically have the first semester , the great head-shake .
the continuity of the continuity , depending on the continuity , and so on .
so often in the third part of the time .
but that is absolutely important when you want to make things very , very intuitive .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is this .
sounds very banal , but really exciting when you engage with it .
so we have the front of the eyes , and now we think we &apos;re looking backwards .
that &apos;s wrong .
they start from the back to the front .
because they &apos;re making an assumption on the front , that you see something that you can detect , <unk> circle .
so , let &apos;s see , first of all , we &apos;re seeing this before we see it coming back into our <unk> , to say , okay , okay , we &apos;re going to see that .
i have such a cognitive baseline , you have what you want to see .
so that &apos;s where it is , and then it comes back .
and then it goes back to the beginning because the back of the day doesn &apos;t go back and say , now look , look at it , and make sure that what you see is what you want to see .
and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s actually first seen .
so , very exciting process , just how certain things happen , and what &apos;s going on in action , these things happen .
i don &apos;t know who owns this image .
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve just described to you .
now , everybody &apos;s trying to see from this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who sees that .
does anybody see anything ?
a <unk> , right ?
so once i &apos;ve seen that , that &apos;s a place in there , you know that .
they &apos;ll never forget anymore , because i &apos;ll show you where the gap is .
now you can see the <unk> .
and on , now you always see him .
that is , i actually spoiled them , that they don &apos;t recognize any patterns anymore , but i have , in a very short time , to see this dog in this obscure picture .
and this is the projection of seeing , feedback , vision .
now i know it , and now i &apos;m going forward to see that i see the <unk> .
i see the <unk> .
so very exciting processes , which then , at this point , actually , is not actually , but it &apos;s just really going to work out there in this apocalyptic crowd .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
if i know it takes three seconds to sort of get out of the present time , i can also bridge very well to bridge it , in which i always use it for three seconds .
it has to process first as an present .
then it moves into the past , and so i can bridge very elegant <unk> , for example , on the computer when i know this phenomenon .
what do <unk> milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
it &apos;s also a very interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the period of time you fall in love .
that means to say , &quot; hey , if you know that now , pay attention to who you like for a long time , because i don &apos;t have any <unk> for anything that can happen to you .
and <unk> milliseconds , also a very interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time of most of the sensations that we have .
that is , that first impression happens in a fast fast speed , as we perceive things .
and also , as we can see things , what we look at and how we kind of protect ourselves against our environment so that we can look at it accordingly .
and of course , the designers , of course , is not just concerned with the subject of perceptions and neural behavior , or <unk> , but primarily of course , with the world &apos;s theme .
so , a human being is doing things accordingly .
you have the practical functions , the practical functions , so the formal aspects or sharp aspects .
there are starfish where i know exactly where i &apos;m going to go .
but in fact , there &apos;s symbolic functions , so why do you have a little bit of a model for something like that , which is almost not so handy to money , even though it &apos;s not that practical ?
so there we are , actually , on symbolic , on the climate crisis that we face as designers , of course .
coming back to my actual topic of natural user interface and the theme , which is , of course , <unk> .
health care is always how can i reach a certain goal for the very quickly , or how can one users be able to achieve a certain kind of goal , effectively , efficiently and adoration .
that &apos;s how much it &apos;s going to be about the norm .
how do i make something more interactive ?
can i use that directly or take my n manual or i need a corresponding training for it .
and it &apos;s less <unk> or more painful .
i &apos;m going to make this a different type of error and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better .
you have to understand that .
and then , in part , if you look at the software that we just saw , then you will understand why independent percent of our current software today is slightly intuitive or not based on <unk> , even though it &apos;s more intuitive than classical software .
and , you know , military <unk> is not so much from apple as a basic <unk> , adult guitars , if i just want to harness the technology of people .
why ?
because , in the case , we &apos;re usually through this new kind of imagination , the natural user user , for example , five times the average on our goal .
you have to imagine that if you do something of the classical , five hours , you need five hours , and you need this new kind of software for an hour of natural software .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re probably going to be able to do four hours more , but your employer , or someone , you &apos;re going to figure out how to do it with the four hours .
but i want to say , of course , that we have a corresponding probability of being able to do certain things .
so if we go back to the realm of software , here &apos;s the first <unk> interfaces that were very abstract , where you needed months to deal with these systems .
and then the next one , which is already based on &quot; a studio &apos;s neural model , or mental model like the software , worked on , you have an idea of something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop , to harness the computer .
so , no more zeroes and ones or <unk> code , it &apos;s a metaphor .
and this has been doing a lot better , but , of course , there &apos;s a lot better than that .
the next generation of the project has been doing a lot more with behavior .
so i &apos;m designing as a designer , much more often than what it looks like .
that &apos;s also a paradigm paradigm .
all of a sudden , i suddenly think that the appearance of success is going to be a application .
and then when i step back into this natural user interfaces , where i am by voice , by language , by touch , by gesture , by gesture , with a mouse to control , i &apos;m still faster and left .
but that brings me back to the point , when do things get more intuitive ?
when you become more intuitive , and then i have to stretch back to my little friend here , and look , what does it mean , from the point of view , when is really something really intuitive ?
and that , for us , is always a little intuitively if i have to think about it little .
so , you know , he doesn &apos;t like to think , but it &apos;s easy to make these jobs .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
that is , if we look at the fact that we can transfer existing interfaces from one to something else , for example , the metaphor , i can use it as a designer .
that is , i can transfer a kind of intuitive , human philosophy on software , and to make the software a lot more substantial .
now , of course , the question is , what is the most powerful warning of human beings , and now i &apos;ve already described it .
this is something called the forest forest .
this used to be used by all of us and <unk> , and that is an acronym , and it stands for convictions , to select , to inform .
that &apos;s what all of you do , but it &apos;s unconscious , and it &apos;s kind of intuitive , or partly , instinctively .
the model is already in the womb , and it &apos;s <unk> , so it works around young and old , and it &apos;s being used all the time without most of us even knowing that this model is present .
<unk> <unk> will ever be about 50 to fifty times of activity , so in sleep , you have found that it &apos;s going to often become less reflective than the day .
now i can orient this mental risk of mind , select , inform , <unk> , translate to a <unk> .
and through this kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the <unk> , but now is no longer a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a <unk> , a reason .
and this is based on a greater grail of an classic metaphor than a recreation of classic metaphor , which is the desire .
and if i go into this now , for example , where i think of as the most familiar , select as a choice , i can look out at it , i can look at it in detail , and i can look at it , and i can put it out there somewhere or shop or buy somebody , and so on , and so on , and so on .
then i can translate the whole thing .
i &apos;m going to try one example .
now , everyone has already eaten pies .
je : now , as i &apos;m interacting with the object , i can zoom in .
i &apos;ll get the whole overview of it , can now filter this , and say , just show me some chocolate .
and once upon a time , an interface which is more intuitive and much more natural .
because i can reach things like the piece that i can , and they come to me , is far more natural than if , by hierarchical organized websites or other mechanisms , they can make these things accessible .
imagination is more <unk> more than <unk> , and with that sentence , i &apos;d like to close as well as a and again choice , as designers have to think in order to make new solutions , and in that sense , i thank you very much for your attention and your attention .
i want to give you access to a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first , if you get a child big , as a baby , is that you take care of what <unk> you have , right ? and depending on whether your parents have allowed them to play more or less in the classroom and move , the more , their curiosity , of course , gets involved with it .
and the curiosity can &apos;t learn .
that &apos;s why all of you who are here and curious are actually people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m going to talk about it now , basically , all this <unk> , <unk> , 40 years of time , in quality of power .
and there &apos;s a central point here .
and it depends on phosphorus .
give a weekly opportunity .
you spend on order every day by about two grams of phosphorus , and every day you have to add two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could just slide as amorphous <unk> through the hood .
if , in fact , we don &apos;t pick and push phosphorus .
well , amazingly , we &apos;re dealing with something here , which is actually a course of a course , but it &apos;s not like that .
because everyone talks about energy , but nobody is talking about the education problem .
the health care system is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we have only two years phosphorus , and now we have a lot more uranium in the world than being used in all nuclear plants .
in the last two decades alone , 509 tons of uranium have been distributed in the fields in germany .
and this is what we take .
it &apos;s leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re slightly less harmful .
so , for example , the environment , driving the environment , is driving less .
<unk> the environment , make less waste .
<unk> the environment , preferably less energy .
but that &apos;s not a protection .
it &apos;s like , if i would say , your child will pass three times rather than five times .
it &apos;s just a little less unstable .
if we think about from the <unk> to the edge of the earth , our entire earth will sooner or later a graveyard .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s like to think about . &quot;
and the most important thing to look at the ground is to look at the ground .
there &apos;s over a 60 percent of carbon stored in the ground .
at the moment , we &apos;re building corn and lost between 11 and 30 pounds of 30 tons of 30 tons per hectare , or in the square meter .
that means we &apos;re going to lose about five thousand times more than it is new .
and of course , we can look at the <unk> test .
and everything is all packaging or content .
for example , in <unk> , 20 percent of the world &apos;s gdp has now diapers .
and as we age , their nappies will be larger .
this is , in a way , everybody in the coalmine .
yes ?
a baby needs about six thousand nappies .
we could , of course , reduce that by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this will be balanced in china in a second .
this is completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we go with these diapers ?
here &apos;s one of the proof that men are not pigs .
let me tell you .
because the phosphorus is emitted with the solid components of poo .
people about the urine .
yeah .
so men aren &apos;t able to be pigs .
because that &apos;s what it &apos;s for , right ?
traditionally , we think in the production world , we &apos;re too many in the world .
and if you &apos;re telling people to exist , if you say it &apos;s better , you wouldn &apos;t be there , you &apos;re going to be sharper and hostile .
and so somebody like al gore says , one of our great heroes , there is nothing more vulnerable than the human population to stabilize .
in israel , you say , if you squeeze a human life , you will open the earth .
it says that the more you walk , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on the earth , the ants weigh about four times more than us .
i could take termites too , but in the u.s. , nobody loves termites in that way , even though they &apos;re vegetarians .
that means that ants weigh much more than we do .
and because they work physically harder than we do , and because they live only three to six months , they live in their weight , in the use of 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , right ?
and where do you see how far we &apos;re away from what we really wanted to do and could , and how sad we are , that we are at all on earth , can you see that for example , there &apos;s a program for example , for example , to 20 , you want to be here , right ?
they can be opinion-driven if they don &apos;t exist , right ?
the only opportunity .
have you ever seen a carbon-neutral tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that means our whole intelligence means we want to be dumber as trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is <unk> .
luckily not , yes ?
there &apos;s no breeding room in trees .
there are still six and six billion trees left alone .
you &apos;ve heard about some of trees before ?
that means all of our intelligence means we want to be dumber as trees .
and as you can see , even something like demeter , which is the most powerful alliance of biology , it doesn &apos;t allow our own entry to go back .
each year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really must go back into each loop .
and so we &apos;re too many .
just about it .
that means we feel so guilty on the earth that we say , there &apos;s no one-size-fits-all , no <unk> , no barnacles , and as they &apos;re all calling that our own poo go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it makes sure that it makes sense to be less harmful in terms of oil use .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , the highest thing is not to be there , right ?
<unk> , yes ?
they can only have <unk> if they &apos;re not there .
even if you would shoot now , you would have emissions .
so they can &apos;t solve it at all .
we can do it differently .
we can take our nutrients back .
we &apos;re doing agriculture in brazil where we reclaim the nutrients .
very directly , we can put nutrients in agriculture in this way .
we do this in china for example , where we are taking the waste of that .
in china , a project today is still more inclusive , so , yes ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid to help raise our nutrition .
that is , the whole western industrial revolution figures out that the city has always taken , but never had the farmers back .
and by doing that , cities had to grow more and more , because the farmers went to the city and the cities would have to move away from their nutrients .
all western empires are expanding until they don &apos;t make the infrastructure anymore , and then they &apos;re incoherent .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve made eco-friendly civilization about five thousand years because you &apos;re always able to bring the nutrients back .
even today , when they invited for dinner in china , they were expected to stay for as long as they seek the toilet .
because it &apos;s <unk> to walk and ride the nutrients .
you &apos;ve invited them to eat them , not to shoot them .
that means you can see on the internet how to reclaim the nutrients .
the really nice thing is that , if you do that , agriculture generates , biogas generates , on a hectare of land with five thousand people in favelas , a farmer can make about 2,500 dollars , and the plant will wait , chickens and pig grow and vegetables and fish .
and the great thing about this is that the peak in the favelas goes down over 90 percent .
so we don &apos;t need to control people , to be very poor .
we can support them , be good .
this is obviously <unk> , but the sound systems carry themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed so through the design that a farmer just can avoid .
that means that you &apos;re going to go back the door .
and none of these assets , we &apos;ve been building over <unk> over the last 20 years , none of these facilities have ever been dismantled .
they could be easily ruined a liter of water , and then the engine would be ruining over years .
don &apos;t happen .
that means we don &apos;t need to control people , to be very little bad .
we can support them , be good .
that means we need to restore phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do that , you &apos;re going to write out , in germany , the best use of all the sewage plants , which is in <unk> .
unfortunately , not in financial science , but maybe you can do a little bit better at doing this .
because the <unk> plant could best reclaim phosphorus .
and it has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we can see that we can &apos;t do it .
we &apos;ve been using it in holland for over three years .
the dutch government explains that they &apos;re going to be the first country in the world , which is phosphorus .
but we need all of that .
you see , there are two countries who control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s population in the world .
so the opec is a bunch of ectosymbiont .
these are cavernous countries that control 40 percent of the world trade .
and the oil will replace us by other energy sources .
but you cannot replace the phosphorus .
that &apos;s not about making the existing thing a bit less , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and first of all , to ask what the right thing is .
that is , it &apos;s efficiency , not about efficiency .
of course , in holland , you understand that easier because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if for example , your wife is sad , if you were upset them , and you come with 50 roses .
very inefficient .
but all effectively , yes ?
or take a clicker .
a woman in germany eats about six pounds of three kilograms in her lifetime .
here .
it &apos;s not scientifically correct because we don &apos;t know exactly how much time there is going to be done .
but a strange , even in these lighting , i can tell you is very inefficient , but very effective , right ?
one of the things that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s not about resource efficiency , but efficiency .
to ask , what is the right ?
it &apos;s not going to burn a little bit better , and put it around with it , and to lose it in the recycling industry , to lose all the materials for clusters , but first of all , how do you make a cycle ?
imagine mozart efficient .
yes ?
if i put you out for dinner , and i say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with branches and a glass of water .
wonderful , right ?
that &apos;s efficient .
all that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
when you fall in love with somebody , efficiently ?
yes ?
that is , everything that matters in life is not to prevent , avoid reducing .
whole work .
we tell people , oh yes , you don &apos;t have any standard going down in the south .
no , it &apos;s just the right throw out , right ?
where you walk , from , yes , you create <unk> again .
but the wrong stuff .
if you squeeze the wrong things , you have a <unk> .
how we think about north .
that &apos;s where every footprint is consistent .
when they walk , yes , every footprint destroys the floor .
because the ground will die from the ground , the mosses die , and the wind and water is washing the ground away .
but if you &apos;re in italy , any footprint means that the water is staying in the meadow longer .
so , it &apos;s about building a large footprint that will be a marsh .
do not interfere .
we &apos;re saying germany .
yes ?
but when i ask you , how are you like this with your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , <unk> <unk> , right ?
that &apos;s just the cutting off .
so not save , cutting , avoid .
every waste is essential .
and it &apos;s a lust when you see in italy , like the people on the high bow picked up a coke coke car .
because you know , it &apos;s a <unk> process .
it &apos;s a form of <unk> , yes ?
you can show that i was there .
but with the real design , there we go .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed a manufacturing solution , which is at room &apos;s minor fluid .
they can examine where they go and stand .
in two hours , it builds up everywhere .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that they can naturally contribute to biodiversity .
that is , we are useful , not less harmful .
so , you get two cycles .
not everything is , of course , to be compostable .
a television or a washing machine , they only use it , they don &apos;t use it .
just the things , the <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , they have to be that they go to biological systems .
the things that are just used are in technical systems .
but we &apos;re only talking today about biological systems .
yes ?
like , the <unk> , yes ?
in a very direct ad , not for the company referred to disadvantaged , but for the fact that they are now helping this company to succeed successfully .
because we don &apos;t do the things that are free .
yes ?
so if i take you to dinner , and you say that &apos;s free of <unk> , you don &apos;t help to do anything .
no , we emphasize what &apos;s in there .
positive .
so not like <unk> .
not toxic in it .
it &apos;s all that &apos;s in there .
these are the first shoes that you can take down the <unk> , and you can walk in the biological loop , you know ?
all of that is compostable .
and , of course , if we can do that , we believe that we can , of course , for <unk> , for nike , for <unk> , and in the whole industry .
and that &apos;s half of all the world &apos;s assets that are caused by the textile industry .
that &apos;s why you help them , you ask them questions .
hey , อร , do you really be serious ?
because now they &apos;ve changed the climate change already twice .
and i &apos;m not sure that they really suck up .
so , help me do a little bit of this .
but it is .
yeah .
this is what &apos;s just been shown .
that &apos;s it .
we can make things now that if they break , they can come in biological loop .
technical cycles are the same way .
there is a direct mechanism for this .
this is the first green backpack , actually , to go back to the circulation .
so again , in every store , you can pull things out .
when they come , yes ?
remember the droids again ?
when the waste is right now .
all the diapers are running around , almost .
in the countries where people get money .
on the <unk> , but also in the landscape , yes ?
if we change the plastic , so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the amount of energy , if we change the amount of energy , then you can only go back to <unk> , you can use a baby in israel or tunisia in tunisia .
yes ?
just when you take these fates , you take them , you <unk> , and you take the powder to plant trees .
that &apos;s the baby window for all life , from the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be predictive ; we can be predictive .
it &apos;s sort of a <unk> , consistent cube .
yeah , so , sort of .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything again .
i started an institute .
there &apos;s a lot of people working there now , and they can engage .
there &apos;s extra a club to talk about where everyone can participate .
so stop saving , cutting , avoid , reducing , not cutting , but intelligent waste .
do you curious ?
thank you .
the <unk> work .
music as a language .
in the description of my talk , it &apos;s written that i as a coach designer , i think , in english , i understand .
<unk> are the translator on the written notes in sharp music .
that , as a translator , you can actually transfer not just word for word to the text into another language , but also to understand the deeper sense of words and space in order to make it a useful translation , everybody who has to do with <unk> .
even from german to translate into english , more knowledge can require , especially if you go to poetry or even poetry .
but it &apos;s really alien to people who are doing what we musicians do with our teammates .
as an outgrowth of a chess camera , i first got the written notes .
you can think that the composer in the notes has exactly everything that he imagined .
in fact , the notes are very vague and inaccurate .
these notes are about as exact as a verbal , as well as a verbal language , albeit very seemingly accurate , description of a landscape .
because in this verbal language , the smell of flowers is not to smell , the degrees of being able to not hear the wind of the wind , not to hear .
that is , the interpreter needs to translate these <unk> aspects of the trajectory to another , which is scotch , non-verbal translation translation .
what i want to translate to you today is what i like to translate to the other piece of music , which is open , again , to translate into language language .
so basically , a translation of translation .
so i prefer to do the whole thing in german , because if i have to translate it again to english , it would be equivalent to the translation of translation of translation .
so those , the music works for me as much as the spoken word .
the <unk> notes have the capability of a writing .
so it &apos;s not going to do just to learn just grades and to press the keys on the piano or the right place on the piano .
because that &apos;s just the letters you learned to paint .
you can only tell the letters when you can do the language .
hence , you need to change the learning process of music at least as long as spoken language .
in fact , there &apos;s also a question of whether you learn it for the <unk> , just passively understands , or you can also talk , to talk to the musical graves .
the work of the elevator starts kind of like a rosebush .
first of all , when you chose a piece to play , because you &apos;re excited about that , you start out for the past life of the composition of composition .
you collect information about the piece in the coalmine .
you read in the letters , <unk> , notes , or you have words , thoughts of composers themselves .
you study the works that it &apos;s composed before and after .
and you compare comparisons .
the instructions to write it .
how and what did he feel ?
what were its conditions like the society and the politics ?
this is what interests me .
you think of yourself as that time by looking at contemporary images or watching literature .
but over time , you have a rich knowledge for the composers that you play more often , and it &apos;s getting easier and easier to empathize and feel in it .
the composer becomes more and more of the friend you live with .
his desire to write the piece is getting more and more and more to my personal concerns to play it .
so , since the notes are anything other than the accurate record of the composer of the composer , but only a framework , i turn now this framework to bring it back to purpose and meaning .
and i say to my own words what might be written between this framework .
i &apos;ll play what those notes might have to mean .
now for me and for the composers at the time , and what you might mean for him today .
every tone , every explanation gets a sense because i feel it myself , because it &apos;s from my personal life , personally .
it has to be <unk> for me , and i can &apos;t convince my audience that this is my cause .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , if i may have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve made a long time to experience in advance the long term .
as you experience a happy new day again , whenever you have the same rituals of life , stand up , having breakfast , you go to work , you have the same play over and over again .
i got older once a day , changing seasons , my heart is slowing down at night than in the morning , in a auditorium , it takes longer that the sound comes back to back than at home .
i take the breath of the audience true , consciously or unconsciously .
all of that affected me , and all of this changes my experience with composition .
it &apos;s also a wonderful thing when i &apos;m standing on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , consistent conversation .
you bring in a new idea , and you talk this answers with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things that we didn &apos;t really practiced , and whatever you can &apos;t take from .
it &apos;s great fun to make music in this way , and as the audience is then experiencing how the music communicates alive .
so every concert is another concert .
i will never play like that in the moment .
i can &apos;t play that way in 20 years today .
that &apos;s where i &apos;m going to have more experience than today , and i &apos;m going to have a lot more experience on my palette of computer research , with emotion and emotion than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some paint paint , but also have some new pressures for it .
have a nice example to this .
it was on a <unk> basis for my beloved old teacher , professor <unk> <unk> , who was a well-known <unk> , <unk> and a long time professor of <unk> here in <unk> .
unfortunately , i was too young at the time , so i finally started studying .
but i was very lucky to meet him very early at age 13 , and so i was on the classes for my classes .
i was 17 years old , when i was at one of his courses , and i played the last of the four notes of chopin , a <unk> .
he asked me what the introduction of this epiphany was to me .
it &apos;s such a humbling part .
and in my book book , i said , expectation .
and he said , &quot; and he said , &quot; so ?
this must be the <unk> .
because for me , it &apos;s memory .
he was in his sixties .
well , at 17 , you have dreams , but there are no major memories .
i &apos;ll play the play every few years now , and it &apos;s been changed for me , although not a single note has changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , because over and over again , i read something new .
an example of a completely different set of cards : monet &apos;s <unk> painted .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but at different time , with different light .
he translated the <unk> <unk> , as he saw it , as they looked at at that moment .
his personal breakdown of the theremin .
the <unk> interpretation of a piece is comparable .
i &apos;ve now been older than chopin at the time when he wrote the play .
he only lived for five years .
and it &apos;s important to me , to keep looking at the notes , even if i think it &apos;s memorized .
to keep <unk> , right with the composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
most of all , if it died .
well , how do you begin to speak the language of music ?
i said yes , you need to have about the same spoken word for the spoken spoken word .
a lot of times , the argument is that you only learn the grades .
you learn virtually first this before you talk only one word .
you learn to find the notes on the note on the instrument .
and when all the fingers are in time and just as much as it is in the notes , it &apos;s moving out sounds that sound like music .
when that fits it all , students will get the most wonderful piece .
we &apos;re barely talking about interpretation of interpretation .
all right , so that &apos;s the front line , that &apos;s a quick piece .
<unk> , slowly .
so loud and b , et and b , etc .
that &apos;s what most of us know here .
but even if you translate these data , it &apos;s still just a bit technical .
and it &apos;s still not a interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that often you forget a little bit more clearly .
and that is , to make music on the instrument , to do your own musical game , you should be there before .
that &apos;s because singing .
a child who didn &apos;t learn the singing , because the parents don &apos;t do it , will not do it themselves .
this is like <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to have your own experiences and the idea of music , then to have another possibility of making a sound .
people who never said , have never felt immediately with your own body , what it &apos;s like to make a sound .
and just make a phrase with its own breath .
the music model is the extension of your body .
our vocal chords to singing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the <unk> in the piano are the sequel of my fingers .
the melody comes from the <unk> and the rhythm of the dance .
the infamous health care today with music is not an obsession .
you don &apos;t need to make yourself music anymore when it gets bored .
no longer required whistling or sing .
all of your music will be tainted if all of the time you have music on the outside .
sure , there are some of you who say yes , but what do you do if i don &apos;t actually sing ?
i ask you , can &apos;t you sing , a , because you believe you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
in both of them , it &apos;s not too late to start , to see if they can &apos;t do it , or learn how to do these little muscles that are putting the vocal chords together .
because you can train that .
or c , because it tells them they &apos;re megalomaniacal .
i ask , you know , how influential competent was this diagnosis ?
have you been getting a <unk> or a <unk> , as you say right now ?
or d , you don &apos;t like to add music , and therefore you want to be a failure .
so what i would say is , because music is a beautiful , evocative thing to do .
but maybe you can still hold them around .
well , you can see , no one must have to be a <unk> candidate .
but don &apos;t tell me , i don &apos;t understand the classical music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
there i am , but surely you can tell if they like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it says somebody , i don &apos;t know if it tastes to me , because i can &apos;t cook .
so , you don &apos;t get rid of dinner , just because you can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to get rid of classical music , because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
consciously listen to them and say whether it tastes or not .
whether the music is too offensive or too sweet .
tell what they feel .
over time , they get claims , and they want to have some more spices out there , or they even taste beautiful differences .
now , why am i asking my audience to be actively listening ?
because the music is language and language is to communicate there .
a piece of work you never look at has no strength whatsoever .
the food being eaten by a cook or a chef as a cook has to be eaten , not just viewed or recipes .
so please listen when a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice baseline .
if in an area where adult music is active , or at least actively hearing music , a child grows up , it &apos;s easy to say , what color has your flower ?
can you play it in blue now ?
and the child is playing , after a <unk> , rather than a blue flower before .
and this sounds very different than before .
that was the first beginning of a musical expression .
so the first step in a interpretation .
and what happens if you play a piece today that was originally written a hundred , ago , or even three hundred years ago ?
meanwhile , the instruments have moved .
there used to be solar as an instrument at all .
it was just not fiction .
i think the bach would have been amazed if he had had the verbal opportunity of the modern pianos today .
i can now make the <unk> that the bach had had , to sound on the modern wing , which can &apos;t be a sustainable driver .
beethoven also knows that he heard more when he had already become deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything that would have been rejected by the orchestra at the time .
and so the composers on us depend on <unk> , reinventing the pieces again .
so they can audible up what they &apos;ve just dreamed of in mind .
and also , what you would think in the mind today .
or what i &apos;m thinking about today , because what you might have thought about .
thank you .
do you know what envy is ?
have you ever been jealous ?
and how did that feel ?
it sucks .
i have a friend who drives a <unk> .
and when i get there with my little v w , i &apos;m going to ask you , it &apos;s that feeling .
i &apos;m sending some through my head .
i say , do you need this n big car ?
that &apos;s what loses half of its value for the first year .
and at all , you work much less than i do .
why do i have to afford a small , small car ?
and then immediately , it falls to me , that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , that uncomfortable feels away .
our organism has invented a great method to keep those unpleasant feelings of envy easy to disappear .
they can try it in words like revenge or <unk> or whatever .
i want to talk to you about this mechanism today , or disturbing what you &apos;re probably familiar with you today .
the mechanism comes from a lie .
but don &apos;t think of the lie as you may have heard , when people say no one has an intent to build a wall .
and then stones put them off so they would take it off .
on one type of a lie , you can see that the liars itself doesn &apos;t believe what he &apos;s saying .
it &apos;s easy to make sure that it &apos;s completely different .
he merely invites you and not herself .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about has to be fooled by themselves .
you need that lie to get an injury at self-deception .
they can collapse . they can collapse , or they can collapse .
you need time .
this is an anecdote that you may be familiar with .
the spanish painter illustrious picasso once has painted a woman .
and this woman complained afterwards the portrait wouldn &apos;t look like her .
picasso , just wait .
they &apos;re always more similar .
at this point , and when you &apos;re laughing , you see how important the lie is and how much time you need to learn what artists can tell us .
because artists have high relation to lie .
the artist will share with you something , and especially this lady , which she doesn &apos;t see when she &apos;s just looking in the mirror .
the artist shares you in a portrait of something that you &apos;ll be first familiar with if you look at this piece of work again and again .
then this awkward feels disappears , and it doesn &apos;t look like it at all , and it &apos;ll always become more like it .
here you have this mechanism where we can use the lie as a great invention to the advancement of our online technology .
and it &apos;s not just in the art , not just in the art community , in the mythology , in stories .
you may know this idea of the lady that looked in the mirror every morning and asked him who is the most beautiful in the country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a more beautiful one .
behind the seven mountains and so forth .
and you also know how much hostility out of that actual record , even the mirror can &apos;t lie from this true dna system .
but we should just be familiar with the fact that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a more beautiful one somewhere else .
so here &apos;s what we have to understand , and we put it over and over again .
we need , in this place , a lie that affects the illusion , without which we can &apos;t live at all .
we have not only been in art , in <unk> , but in science , such great lies .
and there is this story of the woman &apos;s prelude of <unk> .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the origin of species and human descent .
that the human being should be inspired by the monkey and , yes , a common ancestor there was between people and monkeys .
and then she &apos;d run her up to her husband and said , well , that &apos;s probably not true what charles wrote there .
the human being should have a common ancestor or a common ancestor .
no , no , it &apos;s not possible .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to stop the people who know it .
why do we stop people knowing that when it comes true ?
because we can &apos;t live without life .
because we at self-deception , this feeling of being great , comes from the highest creatures , not of one such type of machinery , from something like an organism that exists like an organism , comparable to a rock and whatever things that are for us .
so , we cannot bear these things at all .
we need to prevent people knowing things about things , then when they are true .
and so you can see how slowly this mechanism is dwarfed and what the traces that he &apos;s leaving to something else than this magnificent image of ourselves , i want to tell you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , i mean .
my wife told me .
she came one day from school , she &apos;s teacher , and she told me about a student .
a 16-year-old student .
she really loves it because he has a propensity for sincerity .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m in the firemen .
and because i &apos;m in the fire department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
yeah , you feel it when you &apos;re gay there . there &apos;s something wrong there .
i told my wife , whenever a human being in a moral waiting because of the use , we &apos;re supposed to be trying to replace it by replacing it .
do that once , and then you experience the sentence .
even though i &apos;m in the fire department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
you feel that that &apos;s the truth behind it .
such a <unk> , which is not interested in ballroom dancing .
that &apos;s what interests you in .
but there are no clubs where we can look around where you learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s only the second best thing , the fire brigade .
and he signed up .
and also , you know , your teacher doesn &apos;t say that you like to put fire somewhere and get excited when the fire comes out afterward .
no , it just looks much better when we show that we are in charge of cleaning out the risks , the other one can do it when they put on fire .
here you have that little mechanism .
and it turns out that these <unk> , in the heart of the <unk> , they actually knew that he was actually related to the fire , but he can &apos;t say that loud .
here you have this schism between unconscious and a conscious feeling that jumps out immediately without having to do something about it , and the things that you know look very different is designed to make you feel much better for you and other people .
and so you can just use those words that we use in the language of the politically correct vocabulary and again .
we actually know that something else is the case .
but we know when we say , the social relationships are very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to present those things in a society that &apos;s supposed to work .
so i want to describe to you now what we found in my institute .
by which logic , this deception , the willingness , the willingness for a different reality than the ones that we already know in the unconscious world that it &apos;s valid to spread out .
to this , i want to give you two examples , maybe three examples .
the first example is ahead of what many of you know , and some of you estimate , very few of them don &apos;t need at all .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is kind of an intellectual , says about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that is not from stop <unk> , tangible nature .
and if you &apos;re in front of people who have the committed belief that they have a soul , or you can also say that they have been brought to life to life , then they &apos;re going to imagine that the soul is such an intellectual framework , not from matter , it &apos;s just from meat and blood , something <unk> , to the earth .
and from that soul you &apos;re thinking that somehow you &apos;re in this apocalyptic nature , in this <unk> nature , in the latin states , it &apos;s in latin greek , the <unk> .
and then when this session comes over to people , it &apos;s filled with dignity , with nature that can only live , just with soul .
and then it can <unk> .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
so it &apos;s supposed to get from the outside to the people .
so , let &apos;s think of it as something that is necessarily supposed to be present for our lives .
and if you have that premise in perspective , you can understand the logic that we &apos;re seeing of this happiness , through a lie , to improve our world .
because now you can use a <unk> application .
you &apos;re still familiar with school .
this is now a silicon eye that describes a logic .
this is the hardest part in my talk , by the way .
here you need some logic , but also to lie the willingness .
because that &apos;s how to lie that you can just use this logic wrong .
in this pool , there are three sentences coming out .
the first sentence is , <unk> says there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if it &apos;s true , it has no soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i highlighted him in particular .
a third sentence that immediately comes up with people who have a strong sense of a soul .
they say , who &apos;s not a soul , that &apos;s dead , and can &apos;t say anything .
and here &apos;s it already .
here &apos;s the logic in this , yes , in this apocalyptic talk , to the expression .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they make sense correctly .
because i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t really make a prediction about reality .
i can say the <unk> is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , the <unk> is a man .
if i don &apos;t right , the <unk> is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a point about what &apos;s going on .
i can claim it all .
but critically , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s really true .
so if there &apos;s no soul , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things make logically correct .
and now our cognitive awareness feels instantly , so you can do something .
it depends on a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences and pretend that the opposite of the first sentence has already proven and said .
because we &apos;d have to prove whether or not there &apos;s the soul .
but with this logic , which is simply using the fact that two sentences are logically , and a third type of reason that looks like it had to do with it , that we can save our transportation systems .
so , we pretend it &apos;s actually impossible to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about that .
we can continue these things in different ways .
in the present , for example , we have a modern , modern example , which is over and over again .
to this , you have to have another philosophical theme , a philosophy from philosophy , your present .
and that has to do with that we go back into the 21st century .
there was a fellow fellow who was called johannes <unk> , and after that , they named coyote .
the spruce mule is a mule that is made of pure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
this is something like this .
and if you place the exact middle of the middle there in the middle , it <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know which kind of convergence he &apos;s supposed to go to .
so he &apos;s standing right in the middle .
this is the main story presented .
<unk> forces with <unk> <unk> solve each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening there .
it &apos;s only when you take another example , so if you make it a scary one , you don &apos;t need common sense , you don &apos;t need anything .
and automatically he runs him with the right idea .
so if you have this idea , that in nature you somehow get driven by the larger crowd that put you right now , you quickly have the sense that there must be such a free will .
and if we &apos;re already at <unk> here , i remember the housing area for brain science .
there &apos;s a fellow fellow , who is called the &quot; wolf singer , &quot; and of him sometimes says , &quot; wolf singer , &quot; there &apos;s no one-size-fits-all .
now we can make the second sentence again and say , if the wolf singer is right , he has no authentication .
these sentences are absolutely logical and accurate .
and what we can read almost every day in the newspaper , that &apos;s the third sentence .
it looks something like this , who has no privacy , can &apos;t be drawn for its actions and claims for responsibility , and it &apos;s therefore <unk> .
again , you have it again .
in fact , you &apos;d have to show out if there &apos;s anything like this .
but the logic of deception allows us to do this as if the first sentence of the first was wrong , as if you don &apos;t have to assume the opposite of it .
and now you can just , if you want to do anything yourself , if you want to test anything , and especially if you want to make people happy , that &apos;s the audacity for lie .
practice , for example , if you encounter a person who you can say , there are no prizes .
and please don &apos;t use the word for <unk> , which is the prophet .
you can &apos;t call that , this is again a little bit more mature .
say , there are no prizes .
and you &apos;ll see , immediately , for which there &apos;s such a <unk> , you can &apos;t prove that .
and already they have a problem .
because while you &apos;re busy doing it , you can &apos;t prove that you cannot prove that there &apos;s no <unk> , the man is very happy .
he &apos;s happy about it because he deceived them .
because he led them on a canvas , and he doesn &apos;t bother himself .
because , in fact , this person is not interested in evidence .
he &apos;s just interested in having to prove herself in front of the need to prove that there are deaths .
so , in the way the burden of the burden , you see the magnificence of lying .
and once you have an opportunity to feel that visceral thing in other people , you do it because you &apos;re going to make other people happy if you don &apos;t remember them in this way .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;ve been allowed to see if i may mention it .
she &apos;s one of the main themes here of this great event , and asked me if i wanted to take a talk here and show my idea .
i have to say , you know , you saw it really hard to talk to me about my idea .
and i may be able to imagine that i &apos;m trying to introduce you .
but , of course , the sum is the sum , many ideas .
now i &apos;m probably , the two nice girls are still there , i &apos;m probably one of the generation that has turned on for the bad green image , because i &apos;ve begun to study international engineering in <unk> , engineering college , now it &apos;s called kit .
and i ended up in the middle of the 1980s to berlin , because i wanted to do renewable energy , and that wasn &apos;t in central afghanistan .
there was the marginal brass lamp .
those were used in those days called <unk> , too .
this is the names today .
because a good engineer can either build or <unk> .
but something like an n <unk> out of the square foot , that was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy anglerfish .
i &apos;m grateful for the fact that he has the word again , because after the time , you weren &apos;t allowed to use the word anymore because everything left was bad .
but in the early years , it wasn &apos;t that way in the early years .
it was just like , you know , there was <unk> <unk> , and one of them was sitting in <unk> , where you thought evil .
and that was the <unk> , but that was called a <unk> , and it &apos;s made wind and solar power , and that &apos;s where i started in the mid-80s .
and , yes , much of what was said today , i &apos;m very , very emotional , because many , many beautiful expressions that i &apos;ve lived through .
so , for 11 years , i worked in the collective , that was azt .
we were twenty people .
when one of them said , if one of them has been saying , the <unk> , which has got a whole <unk> , and i &apos;ve spent 10 years trying to figure out , i &apos;ve got it hard for 10 years to get off , because all of my father &apos;s colleagues , you know , suck up , you &apos;ve got the money on the window of your kid .
it &apos;s engaging with insanity .
and that was really , really bitter , really bitter , and you &apos;ll come in like that in the context , and i just showed you a little bit about where i &apos;ve been asking , after 10 years , a thousand , thousands of years ago , that &apos;s when it &apos;s really been so good to do that .
and i then made it until <unk> made , and then with friends , i &apos;ve become cofounder of the company , who then became a cofounder of the company of the world , who became one of the largest choreographers in the world .
well , one of the things that we &apos;ve been doing , of course , is the problem of a growing enterprise , and we have a small group , a small group , decided that we will start small again and go back to the next topic of the future , and that means to me , it &apos;s kind of crazy , it &apos;s kind of crazy , that &apos;s starting to say , people say , what &apos;s the skill , that &apos;s all we &apos;re talking about , we &apos;re talking about translation .
and i brought a project that i &apos;d like to introduce you to now .
and the title of the talk was , yes , a hundred percent renewable returns .
and we just started to wonder with a fairly elemental story , where , you know , where could you make a memory today ?
on this island , this is the island of <unk> on the island .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
there are four and a half thousand people .
they have an increase from 15 percent today .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have any more ?
it just doesn &apos;t really work .
if you spin more , the system starts to fail .
this is why i &apos;m always telling the politicians when she &apos;s investigating our facility .
they always say , why ?
we &apos;ve got 20 percent in germany .
it can &apos;t be a problem .
it &apos;s not that we have seven percent in europe , and our net is physically seen by the european .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we would have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was just , just figure it out , we &apos;ve got the first contact with the island , just calculate it .
how big a battery would have to be so that you could have an island of 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe 70 percent renewable .
and yeah , i &apos;ll go on to a slide again .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , a hundred of them , by the way , are going to be about a hundred .
that &apos;s the power of a hundred nuclear power costs , because it &apos;s very fast everywhere .
the <unk> in the world that &apos;s going on is taken out of diesel , because you don &apos;t need permission .
this is going fast .
and you go like this a box .
and then it looks like the rule .
in that time , there are three of the <unk> , two of them always waited .
yeah , this is what one looks like at the bottom is the load .
we also have very detailed data .
and the solar system or the solar system , or whatever it is , is typically a viable system , or a system , which is just a small thing in small quantities here .
our goal was just to say , okay , okay .
the diesel becomes <unk> , and the wind , sun is eating the burden so that they can map the wider proportion .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , so energy a year , you have to turn off the grain of the grain .
that is , at the moment , you have to make sure that renewables can take the whole web .
of course , you can only , if you &apos;re in some way managed here , of course .
this no one &apos;s done in the world yet .
this is in a little bit style , so you can also use your <unk> over a little bit of your car .
people are always asking me , what are you going to do in <unk> ?
you can do that .
but if you want to have multiple of these <unk> , and you should build a network , that &apos;s going to be extremely complicated .
and our goal was that we wanted to go to 70 to 90 percent renewable and then stay here for this rest , the last 10 , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable supply , which is going to be very , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work that you &apos;re making it from batteries .
it will be a energy source , which then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas you may know or shh , that will be .
you &apos;d really need to go to a <unk> and do it more and not just balance .
we just wanted to know , what about a normal , <unk> electrochemical battery .
so how far can you get there ?
they did a whole bunch of simulation .
and the wind and the wave and the load came together and came up with the result , a very exciting result that , in fact , in the conventional system , which takes a middle american care of about 50 cents a kilowatt-hour , about 50 cents a kilometer .
these were the first calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper like the average room when the five percent is going up five percent a year .
and then we started negotiating with the atrocities .
what would be done to do everything ?
i &apos;ve looked for investors , and i &apos;ve looked for new design calls .
in fact , we were only five people to rebuild society .
and here &apos;s the plot again .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green one is our system .
that our system also has a monopoly , and that &apos;s because , after all , we &apos;re about to make a 20 percent of diesel , and we also do not interfere with the other things .
and the <unk> , which , you know , the internet layer on the island , is really what we find .
let &apos;s also support , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
and so we have decided to build a hall in berlin , in which we can sort of map the electrical ratios of the island at scale to three very accurately .
that means we first looked at finding the greatest battery in the world .
here it is .
it comes naturally from asia , in the case of japan .
and in the early &apos; 70s , it &apos;s been developed in the bbc &apos; 70s , today , and it &apos;s been developed to the japanese .
you can see it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
it has a megawatts of performance , and it can bring six hours to this performance , and that &apos;s the battery that we sort of figured out .
and then put them in there .
we also have one of the same plots in the same size , as it says there in the hall , in fact that the complete dynamic behavior of that web , so in the hall it looks like this , in the back of the grain , that &apos;s where the grain is , here &apos;s the big battery that allows us to simulate the net .
over here , we &apos;re simulating the whole <unk> , the beneficiaries of the wire , to sort of represent the grid system in the net .
and you can see the whole thing again .
we can also put two and a half kilowatts up on the web .
so here we see that again , again , that we &apos;re seeing the diesel , again , again , individual <unk> .
and what we did was , in the early days , the hall was done , until today , it &apos;s almost everything that &apos;s here between the individual system of electronics in software , we did .
so we &apos;re not <unk> , but we &apos;re define as a company that is only in between the battery and the theme and everything in between .
you have to communicate , of course , to the battery , and you can also communicate to the web , and that &apos;s very complicated .
now , the nice thing about this is that , in fact , on this island , everything can be the problem of problems that we &apos;re going to get if we increase our percentage of renewables .
so this whole discussion , what is going to be like going back and forth at the moment , as it &apos;s supposed to go back , for example , on the island , for example , we have the wind and the sun of the sun .
<unk> is then campaigning .
so <unk> , a <unk> everywhere .
we can start to integrate the island on the island , as we can , as a result , to manage the burden of burden .
that is , if you &apos;re 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do that without memory .
you can go through your n , you can walk through the bed nets , yes , you should be doing that in whatever proportion , but you &apos;re never going to be able to get rid of memory .
and that &apos;s the n sort of the message .
that &apos;s why a lot of people come and look at this , because you can see what problems you get .
when we turn out the diesel , you just no longer have that rotating mass that causes some kind of inertia in the net .
and our final experiment is basically just the louder masses of large current current where the wave is all about europe .
we look into this grid , we see 50 hertz , and when it becomes <unk> nine hertz , we &apos;re going to start a couple of <unk> <unk> , then we &apos;ll come back up a little bit of steam steam , then we &apos;ll come back up .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , this is incredibly sexy .
if you zoom in somewhere , it &apos;s a little for a while .
the thermal reserves has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in time , you can react again .
if you don &apos;t have that , that rotating mass , you have to replace that spinning mass .
and we can deflect two milliseconds with this big battery .
so there you can see that there &apos;s enormous <unk> there .
and the message is , we have to get rid of these rotating masses when we sort of like our goals , 20 , 20 percent , 30 , 30 percent , and so on , if we even want to achieve that .
then we have to tear our concentrated capacity on the net .
<unk> is simply saying the power station runs to keep the frequency .
yes , you know , it &apos;s a <unk> right now , depending on because we don &apos;t , or we don &apos;t , because it &apos;s not going to work .
and we just try to make sure that you can bring electrochemical memory to the grid , so you can get electrochemical memory into the grid .
and fortunately , there &apos;s a lot of research now .
and so , for that purpose , people will come and look at us and look at our environmental programs , sort of , our <unk> .
and yeah , the discussion is always about the question of , how far can you walk there a piece of future ?
and many discussions i &apos;ve been in the last six years , much like the discussion i had been with for the last 30 years .
you can &apos;t , you know , shaking , <unk> , we &apos;ve missed everything , never mind .
we &apos;ve got 30 milliseconds in germany today .
this is uce .
and i just say , in the next 30 years , we will have the same capacity of mammograms store all over the world .
simple , this is how it will come .
there &apos;s going to be a whole bunch of <unk> and arguments .
the nice thing is , i &apos;ve been in the last two years that scientists have been to my side .
we &apos;ve now got over 10 million volumes now , even in order to get more serious about the german web .
this will happen in april next april .
so because of that , you also realize that there &apos;s a change there , and you can &apos;t even get there from that wildscape , to the idea , a hundred percent renewable is yes .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable output , it &apos;s like a regimented system .
so , in arguments , there &apos;s always been trying , these <unk> , they make themselves , they have their own little net , they have nothing to do with our compound .
it &apos;s a very simple question , though , if you get totally independent from some fossil or <unk> <unk> that will be swept down anywhere in the world , you &apos;re going to be an island .
and then they just use what &apos;s there on the sun and the wind where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of an unfavorable energy supply , and i &apos;m also grateful that they &apos;ve been told to use solar power .
and that &apos;s what we do , and in this way comes in the same way that we do that , the talk is that you can again take a collective and use solar power , a little bit together .
and yeah , i just want to encourage you , in the sense that you can be a little crazy and you can also have a vision .
and you have to do pretty much , really , but i think it &apos;s going to happen .
thank you .
when steve lopez , the los angeles times , the los angeles times , one day in the middle of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , <unk> , rough , homeless , homeless , who played on a violin with only two strings .
many of you will know the story , because from a book about it , a book that was developed again , with robert downey junior as steve lopez and jamie <unk> as nathaniel anthony <unk> , the <unk> who studied at the university institute and whose very promising career was very early by his former schizophrenia .
nathaniel went in juilliard , suffered a breakdown and 30 years later he lived on the streets of <unk> row at the center of los angeles .
i recommend all of you , reading the book , or looking at the movie , so you don &apos;t only understand the wonderful connectedness that happened between these two men , but also how the music made these connections , and how it ended up being the instrument , when that pun is allowed to get out of the street .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , at walt disney boreal hall .
he had just heard a demo from beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony and came up behind the stage to imagine myself .
he was talking in a very feisty and agonizing clay on yo-yo ma and hillary clinton , and about how the dodgers would never make it into the baseball world series , and that &apos;s all because of the <unk> phase of the first violin on beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
we got to talk to music a few days later , and a few days later , i got an email saying that nathaniel was interested in love for me .
i still have to say that nathaniel may have dropped a medical care treatment , because he was already being treated with electrical electrical and <unk> and handcuffed , a trauma that &apos;s been haunted by his whole life .
and as a result , he &apos;s particularly susceptible to these schizophrenics phases , and they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and he would go away , in the streets of <unk> corner in the streets of <unk> row , always exposed to this horror and <unk> of his own spirit .
and in the same way that was a piece of paper , nathaniel was when we started our first class with walt disney boreal hall , and he was completely lost in his eyes and never lost .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and how someone wanted to poison him in sleep .
i was afraid not to realize , but i was afraid that i could lose him , that he could sink in one of his states , and that i could destroy him his relationship to the violin as i began to talk about scale and connection and other exciting shapes .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s 46664 .
and while i was acting , i realized there was a whole change in nathaniel &apos;s eyes .
it was as though he was under the impact of an invisible drug , a chemical reaction whose catalyst was my catalyst .
nathaniel &apos;s <unk> rage turned into understanding , into a calm curiosity and grace .
and like a miracle , he took his violin , and he began to play a few little snippets of <unk> , and then asked me to come to the end of it : <unk> , <unk> , -8 .
we then started talking about music , from bach through beethoven , brahms , <unk> and all the other <unk> , from <unk> all the way down to <unk> <unk> .
and i realized that he had not only had a comparative knowledge about music , but had a close personal relationship with her too .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i know only about my colleagues in the philharmonic philharmonic philharmonic .
by playing music and talking about music , he was from this splendid , confused man who was just taken through the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , glorious , <unk> trained musicians .
music is medicine . music changes us .
nathaniel means emotional health .
because the music allows him to do his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity to something real .
and so he <unk> his dysfunctional condition .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re doing music : so that we can make something that within us all , deep inside , our emotions , through our artistic lens , through our creativity , through our creativity .
and the reality of that vote gets to us all , moves , inspired and shared .
so what nathaniel set up , he brought the music back into a community of friends .
it took music back into a family of musicians who understood him , who recognized his talent and deleterious .
and i &apos;m always playing playing with nathaniel , whether in the walt disney <unk> hall or in <unk> row , he reminds me of why i became a musician .
thank you .
i thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something i stole the <unk> sea .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
so i knew a lot of fish in my life .
i only loved two .
that first one , that was more like an artistic affair .
it was a nice fish , <unk> , good consistency , <unk> , written books on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was bred in <unk> to the supposedly highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel about selling it .
i had a relationship with that story for several months .
and one day the head of the company rang up and asked if i could take a talk about the welfare of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve what had become the incredible problem for our chefs , how do we keep fish on our menus ?
in the last 50 years , we have the oceans that we have the bare beaten to .
it &apos;s hard to savor the destruction .
ninety percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the <unk> , the lax , the lax , they &apos;re collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so it &apos;s going to be bad , <unk> , a part of our future .
a lot of the arguments on it . the environment pollute the environment , most of you anyway , and they are inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he &apos;s got a distribution of 15 to one .
that means that 15 pounds of glass is required to get a pounds of ink .
not very sustainable .
don &apos;t taste very well either .
so , finally , there was a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to support them .
on the day before , i phoned the head of the public relations for the company .
let &apos;s call it don .
&quot; don &apos;t , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you are famous to grow as far out in the ocean that you don &apos;t cultivate the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; we are so far out that the waste is distributed by our fish . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we are essentially a world .
this led from harvard to 1 , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
franco to one , great .
&quot; franco to one , what ? what do you feed ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said .
and that evening i was in bed , and i thought , well , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so the next day i rang , just before the event , don &apos;t , don &apos;t mind .
i said , &quot; look , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know that . he &apos;ll show an opinion .
well , i spoke with a few people in the company , and no one could give me a cash answer until finally i finally applied to the chief biologist .
let &apos;s call it even don .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what for instance are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; huh ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yeah , feathers , skin , <unk> , waste , dry and processed . &quot;
i said , &quot; what percentage of your house &apos;s house is chicken ? &quot;
in the order of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , what &apos;s sustainable about selling chicken to fish ? &quot;
there was a break in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i salute myself from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
i actually am .
no , i actually stuck away from this fish because , i swear to god , who tasted fish after that conversation after chicken .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s the romantic way , the way in which , the better you learn your fish , the fish loves more .
i first ate him in a restaurant in <unk> .
a <unk> reporter had been talking about this fish for a long time .
it sort of <unk> us .
he came up with a bright , almost white white suit .
the chef had <unk> him .
stop twice .
amazingly , it was still delicious .
who can make a fish so well taste after <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
let &apos;s call him miguel . in fact , he &apos;s being impatient .
and no , he doesn &apos;t eat the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way that you and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at <unk> la <unk> .
this is a figure in the <unk> corner of spain .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river river .
until the 1980s was the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they were growing <unk> on what were basically wetlands .
they did this by globalizing the land .
they built this complicated episode of canals , and they kept out water from the country and out into the river .
now they couldn &apos;t make it possible , not economically .
and environmental , it was a catastrophe .
it took about 90 percent of the birds around what a lot of birds are .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company went green .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of water vice versa .
they have literally thrown the lever .
instead of harvesting the water , they used the channels to restore the water .
they <unk> the canals .
they created a $ 11,000 hectares -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , <unk> -- and they have miguel and his company completely reversed the ecological destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like that .
they looked at the horizon that &apos;s a million miles away , and everything you see are <unk> channels and these dense , lush march .
i wasn &apos;t a long time with scuba .
it &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin , and a part of a croc for dinner . &quot;
okay ? there we were and sat around the wetlands , and i sweat and sweat , i have mud down to my knee , and miguel keeps a <unk> .
here he lifts a rare spike of flowers .
now , he mentioned the impression of phytoplankton .
and here , he &apos;s looking at a pattern of bundle that reminds him of the <unk> giraffe .
it turns out that scuba has spent the most of his career in the european national park in africa .
i asked him how to become such a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i am an expert for relations . &quot;
and then it goes and adapts into more of rare birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the most stupid community , just in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head got weak over this fateful piece of delicious fish that i had at the dinner store .
so i cut it . i said , &quot; appachan , how come your fish so tastes so well ? &quot;
he pointed to the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what are your fish eating ?
what &apos;s the leeches ? &quot;
well he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish eat what they eat in the wild .
the growing biomass , phytoplankton , the animist , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely unauthorized .
there &apos;s no food .
anyone from a farm , who doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
on the day , i went around this site with me with me , and i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be so natural , &quot; unlike any farm i &apos;ve ever been on , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
at the moment , a director would have wanted a bid .
and we bow around the corner , and we offered the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of blue flamingos , a literally visual carpet so far as the eye is .
&quot; that is successful , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your <unk> , pink .
she &apos;s exaggerating . &quot;
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; appachan , don &apos;t mind your fish ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; yes . &quot;
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to the birds .
well last year , there were 600,000 birds , over 250 birds , over 250 different species .
it &apos;s the largest one and one of the most important private economies in europe today .
i said , &quot; miguel , is it a good &#91; unclear &#93; -- not the last one you want on a university party ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not intense .
this is a national network .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the dna , the better the system , the better . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink it . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that measures their success to the lung health .
a <unk> , but also a long-term war .
oh , and by the way , these flamingos should not even be there in the first place .
they breed it for 240 miles away in a town that is better for the benefit .
they fly for 240 miles to a farm every morning .
and they fly 240 miles every night .
they do that because they can follow the <unk> white line of the highway .
seriously .
i had a kind of a journey of penguins , so i looked at this powder .
and i said , &quot; appachan , fly for 240 miles a farm , and then fly it back for 240 miles ?
do you do that for your children ? &quot;
he looked at me as if i was just quoted a song at the whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . they do that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like guns . i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like <unk> .
it &apos;s this intense , evocative taste .
i almost never cook .
and yet , when i tried her in this restaurant in video games , she didn &apos;t tasted what he was talking about .
she liked sweet and in it as though you would take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned this to miguel and he agreed .
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last auction before something enters the body .
it &apos;s evolved over the course of evolution to modernize water . &quot;
and then he added it , &quot; but our water has no authentication . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish , a farm that measures their success on their predators &apos;s success .
and then i realized , if he said , a farm that doesn &apos;t have anything , it &apos;s massive , because the water that &apos;s running through this farm is coming in from the river .
it &apos;s a river that &apos;s going to lead all the things that are about rivers now tend to lead them , chemical pollutants , decay of <unk> .
and when it fought through the system , and that leave the water is clean than it is .
the system is so healthy ; it cleans the water .
not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that measures their success on the health of their predators , but a farm that is literally a <unk> , not only for those fish , but for you and me .
because when the water freezes there , it floats in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and that should be you , because these love stories , as romantic as romantic always always , is telling you .
you might say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> .
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one where food really tasted well .
but for a lot of people , it &apos;s a little too radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we are lover .
we love <unk> . we love little brains . we &apos;re talking about regional food . we eat organic food .
and if you say that these are the things that make good food comfortable in the future , somebody says , &quot; hey guys , i love pink flamingos , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we &apos;re producing enough calories to feed the world more than just feeding .
a billion people will be starving today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of <unk> inequalities in the distribution , not the greenhouse gas net .
now , i don &apos;t like this question because it has driven the logic of our study for the last 50 years .
feed grain on herbivores , <unk> on <unk> , chemicals on the earth , chicken on fish , and all the time agribusiness simply wondered , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how awful can it be ? &quot;
that was the cause . it was the easy place . it was the business business business business business .
we should call them what she is , a business in <unk> , a craft , the fast viable capital that makes all of these production .
this is not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our society today is threatened today , not because of unsustainable resources , but because of limited resources .
not through the latest <unk> and <unk> , but through fertile land , not by pump , but through fresh water , not by chainsaws , but by the forests , not by <unk> , but by forests , by fish in the sea , but by fish in the sea .
you want to feed the world ?
so let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself ?
to do that , look not for the future for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are in there , and it &apos;s never produced anything really good for food .
let &apos;s have a look at the ecological model .
that &apos;s what &apos;s held to two billion years of work .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
businesses that are not worlds for themselves , businesses that dig up , not just to fund them , businesses that are growing , not only to prescribe , but experts in relationships , not only to give them , but experts in relationships .
because they are the ones who are also experts for flavor .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i ever will be .
you know , it &apos;s right , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
so , if i want to reassure you one of the things that we consume is that all of the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of your parts , and instead of thinking about it , i want you to think about how we can use information so that you can make patterns , and we see the trends that otherwise would not be visible .
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical negotiation model of age .
and the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter after a certain cause of change , let &apos;s say accidents .
and immediately i see another pattern that makes up .
and it &apos;s because in the health department here , people are the most active , and they &apos;re at the most competitive stage here .
we can go out and step out and see the data and see that <unk> and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
now , if we go further and to age , say 40 years or younger , we see that accidents are even the cause that people should worry about .
and who knows that this is particularly true with men .
so you can see , this is a way of looking at information and data in this way very , very much in terms of swimming in a lively state of life .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not for content itself ?
what we &apos;ve got here is each of the single &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; which has ever been printed .
it &apos;s all there . it &apos;s all online .
you can actually test it for my talk in their suite .
with deworming , they can be immersed in a decade .
you can dive into a certain year .
you can jump directly down to a certain issue .
so if i look here , i see the athletes that appear in that text and the sports .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong fan , so i go out there , and i &apos;m talking to all expenses in which lance armstrong will show me .
now , if i just want to take a snapshot of view , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at all of this with the topic ? &quot;
so i take a step back and i zoom in .
now i see greg smits .
and so you get an idea that if you look at this kind of information , more specifically , bigger , zoom , you don &apos;t look at them , and you don &apos;t just look at them .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so i want to take you through this idea a little bit more about what &apos;s a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we took every single set of rules and reduced it to a small summary .
the summary contains a short , and a symbol for the area that it comes from .
i &apos;ll just show you the top top of the popular lady .
but even in this narrow view , we can do a lot of things .
now we get a sense of the issues that are on wikipedia .
now i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government .
now , i &apos;m going to know , after i &apos;ve chosen government , i know that the <unk> , which are the most fun &quot; people magazine &quot; in the year .
this is really important , because this is a realization that isn &apos;t in a single menu .
it &apos;s only to see if you go one step and look at the whole thing .
homage to one of these summaries , i can then go into the theme of time magazine &quot; people of year &quot; and see all together .
now , when i look at all of these individuals , i know that most of them are <unk> , some of them come from science . some , even less from the economy , here &apos;s my boss . and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
this is how we can jump and throw a look at every ted prize winner .
you see , we &apos;re browsing the web for the first time as if it &apos;s actually a web , not just from side to side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you something else that might have a little surprise .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website here .
<unk> , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a web browser , but you can look at web sites -- and we can take these <unk> to every single website like this .
so i can take a step back and jump straight into a particular unit .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s important because you can only look at web websites in this way , in this way , to look at all of the entry in the same way .
so i can go in a certain time frame in the space .
here &apos;s the one state of the whole demonstration i &apos;ve given until this time .
and i can , sort of , see everything i &apos;ve been looking at today , again .
and if i go out and go back and look at everything , i can sort of arrange my process , maybe after i go , i &apos;ve got to go to bing , or here for live labs to live here .
and from here i can go into the page and bring them back again .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used again and again , and each time it makes the big picture bigger than the sum of the <unk> .
right now , in the world , we think that data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the oscar system .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
what if we could reverse this situation and put the internet on its head , so that instead of going from one to the other , we start to go from many things to many things , and to see patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
if we can do that , then this past life will , perhaps , make more sense of information .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge from it .
and if we know , maybe we can even draw wisdom from that .
and i &apos;ll stop with that , thank you .
i grew up with a <unk> broad science fiction .
in my school , i was driving the bus to school every day for an hour .
and my nose always stuck in a book , a <unk> , that sparked my thoughts in other worlds , and in a <unk> way my deep curiosity applies to me , voracious curiosity .
and that curiosity also turned out that when i was in the school , i was walking through the forests , walking around the forests , looking at &quot; probes , &quot; frogs and snakes and glue , and pulled it all home and looked under the microscope .
i was completely <unk> , you know ?
it was always about trying to understand the world and the boundaries of the possible explore .
and my love of science fiction seemed to mirror my environment , because back in the late &apos; 60s , we went to the moon and explored the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came up with his fascinating shows that showed us animals and places and a world full of wonder that we never imagined before .
well , that &apos;s a good thing to do with that wildscape .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and since there &apos;s no video games nor all the video games with computer-generated imagery , i had to create the images in my head .
we had to do that at the time . when children read a book , we took the description of the author and projected them on the screen in our heads .
my reaction was to draw and paint from aliens , aliens , worlds , spacecraft , and all that stuff .
in math class , i was constantly caught by the teacher , as i was hiding in the textbook .
creativity somehow has to go out .
and something interesting happened . because what was interesting to me about jacques <unk> shows was the idea of a completely unknown world on earth itself .
i certainly would never reach a alien world with a spaceship , and that was pretty unlikely to me .
but here was a world i could actually walk into , here on earth , and it was just as fascinating and exotic as all i had imagined when i read those books .
so i decided when i was 15 , i decided to be divers .
the only problem with me was that i lived in a small village in canada , a thousand miles away from the nearest ocean .
but i didn &apos;t let myself frustrated .
when i finally met my father , he had finally noticed a <unk> in buffalo , new york , just on the other side of the border where we lived .
i put my head in a pool of research in the middle of the winter in buffalo , new york .
the ocean , but the real ocean , i got two years later to face when we moved to california .
since then , over the 40 years that are <unk> , i spent about 3,000 hours underwater , 500 hours of it in submersibles .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the most mature oceans , is so rich in life , as we really can &apos;t imagine .
nature &apos;s idea doesn &apos;t know boundaries , regardless of our own , human imagination .
up to today , i have profound awe for what i see on my dive .
and my love to the ocean is holding up with the intensity and the same .
when my adult was a profession , it was the filmmaking .
this seemed the best way of telling my inner step , telling stories , with my need to create images .
as a child , i was making comic books and so on .
so movies together were the way , images and stories together . that fit together .
of course , the stories i was proposing for : &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; aah . &quot;
i was able to hook my preference for the underwater issues , and connecting it to the filmmaking .
so these two are my two passions .
one of the interesting things that happened in &quot; <unk> , &quot; was to solve a serious problem in this movie -- and that &apos;s what we had to do sort of a liquid drawing problem -- we did a computer-generated animation , <unk> , back .
and what came out of this was the first computer-generated display ever seen in a movie .
now , the film didn &apos;t take any money , exactly as he was using the cost of manufacturing , but i noticed something : the audience all over the world was mesmerized with the magic that went out of it .
according to arthur clarke &apos;s law , old-fashioned technology and magic are no longer apart .
so they saw something magical .
and that &apos;s what i found incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this must be brought into the filmmaking . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; the next film , much further .
together with deworming , we created the guys of liquid metal , and the success was completely dependent on how this effect would go .
and it worked . again , we had created something magic , and the impact in the audience was the same , but we have a little bit more money with the film .
from these two experiences , a whole new world has arrived , a whole new world of creativity for picnic .
so i started a company , with my good friend stan winston , who was the best <unk> and <unk> , and it was called digital bazaar .
the basic idea of this company was to jump out the phase of analog processes with visual printers , etc . , just to jump out with the digital show .
so we did , and we had a competitive advantage for this as well .
but in the middle of the 1990s , we realized that we were in the business business and real estate , where we actually created the company , too slowly .
i had written this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; which is about to move the vector into visual effects and <unk> effects into whole new heights , with whatever human , expressive characters that had been made , and the speech should be all <unk> , and the world should be <unk> .
but actually hit the bar , and the people in my company told me that we &apos;re not going to be able to do that .
so i shifted that and made this other film about the big ship , the following .
i was selling this as &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship , &quot; which became a <unk> irish order , a passionate film .
but , secretly , i wanted to immerse the real wreck of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio did not know that .
but i convinced them , i said , &quot; we go to the wreckage . we &apos;re filming the real wreck .
we &apos;re going to show it in the movie of the movie .
that &apos;s incredibly important . it &apos;s a good way for marketing . &quot;
and i convinced them to pay an expedition .
sounds crazy . but it goes back to the fact that your imagination can create a reality .
and what we did was we actually created a reality six months later , where i was in the russian six and a half kilometers beneath the surface of the north atlantic , looking at the real titanic through a <unk> .
this wasn &apos;t a movie , not a choreographer , that was real .
so , that blew my mind .
and there was huge effort , we had to build cameras and headlights and stuff .
and it occurred to me how much this fantasy , a <unk> love .
well , they were also selfish and honorable more capable of planning .
you go into those capsule , you go down into this dark , hostile environment where there is no hope for saving , if you don &apos;t create it yourself .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s the same way i &apos;m in a manhole .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was really obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
anyway , having to do with curiosity and science , it was everything . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could then make a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was going to see outside of the window .
some of the next expeditions i &apos;ve seen in <unk> , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that no one had ever seen before , and the science at the time , when we saw them , had no words at all .
so that really resonated at me , and i wanted more .
and so i met a slightly unusual decision .
so after the success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i said to myself , &quot; okay , i &apos;d like to put my <unk> in hollywood as a filmmaker in hollywood and i &apos;ll go for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we approached , we approached , and we were exploring them with <unk> .
we went back to the wreckage of the titanic back .
so we took little robots that we built , which we built , which was a <unk> <unk> .
our intent was to go out and look at the inside of the ship , which had never been done before .
no one had ever explored the inside of the device , and you didn &apos;t have any means for it , so we evolved the technology .
so , there i am now , on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and i see <unk> , who are quite similar to this , and i know that actually played the band there .
and i &apos;m going to fly a little <unk> through the slopes of the ship .
actually , i &apos;m not advocating it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically within the diagram of the titanic present .
that was the most low-tech form of an autorickshaw i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i bent up a corner , i always knew what was going on in the <unk> of the vehicle , because i ran there for months when we turned the film .
so the set was a detailed copy of the ship &apos;s design plan .
so this was a very strange experience .
and she made me realize that this <unk> , that you could use that kind of <unk> , and so your awareness of your vehicle , in this other form of existence , can be helpful .
it was really , truly profound .
and maybe a little glimpse of what might happen in a few decades , if you have <unk> , to explore something , or do things other , in all kinds of logistics that i can think of as a libertarian .
and after these expeditions , we started what we had seen , really appreciate , for example , for example , where we saw these incredible amazing animals , which are like aliens , but here on earth .
they live with the help in chemosynthesis .
they don &apos;t exist in the sunlight management system , as we do .
and so you see animals that go right next to a 500 degrees centigrade that they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also very interested in <unk> , and this was back from my childhood .
and so , i ended up with the people who are interested in space , and they &apos;re having to do with nasa , and they &apos;re planning in the lab and they go to russia , and they go to russia , and we go through the mission on the mission , and then they go to the international record , and they go to the imf , and they go to the imf .
that was fascinating .
but in the end , it turned out that i took deep contact with us in the deep sea .
i took them with , and i gave them access to the world at the bottom , <unk> , <unk> , people interested in such extreme situations . i took them to the sources , so they could take samples and test instruments and so on .
we made out of film making sure , but they actually did science , pretty much .
and so , the circle between my existence was a <unk> , as a child , and the implementation in reality .
and in the course of discovery , i learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m certainly thinking , you know , a director must be able to have a leaders like a <unk> or something .
but i didn &apos;t understand much about leadership before i met these expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what am i doing here ?
why do i do that ? what comes out of this ? &quot;
these ridiculous films don &apos;t bring us any money .
we &apos;re just going to make a cost of manufacturing . there &apos;s no trace .
everybody thinks i was between titanic and &quot; avatar &quot; and would have lifted the nails on the beach for me somewhere .
i did all these films , these documentaries , for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re going to do it for the task , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the most powerful environment that you have , and you make it because of it , because of the strange connection that happens when a small group of people form a team .
because we did all this with just 10 to 12 people working nonstop , and at times we were two or three months in a row in sea .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the suggestion that you have in front of each other , because you have overcome a task that you can &apos;t explain to anyone else .
when you come back to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , the fiberglass , the <unk> , and the whole way , the whole technology , if you &apos;re working on the sea , you simply can &apos;t explain the other one . this is like police officers or soldiers who have gone through something and know that you can never explain it to anybody .
there &apos;s a connection that creates mutual respect .
so when i came back to try to make my next movie &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to use the same leadership , which is that you have your team respected and supported in return .
and so the dynamics really changed .
so there i was , again , with a little team on the unknown terrain , we turned &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that wasn &apos;t there before .
it &apos;s extremely exciting .
an incredible challenge .
and we &apos;ve been to a real family for a four and a half years .
it changed my way of making films , completely .
there were people who said we had really , really , really worked on the planet and pandora &apos;s on the planet .
for me , it was more possible to do my job , the actual process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we end up with ?
what lessons have we learned ?
i think the first place is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human feature .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
and the way you tell your team is more important than any aspect of the world .
i get young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me some advice on how to make this happen . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t worry for yourself .
you &apos;ve got some other for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , bet not against itself , but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa is like , &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in art and for study , failure need to be an alternative , because there is no doubt for it .
not an important operation that demanded innovation has ever been addressed .
you have to be prepared to take those risks .
that &apos;s the idea that i &apos;d like to leave you with . failure is absolutely an alternative , fear , but is not . thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
and that may be surprising to me , because my favorite group at the foundation are mostly about vaccines and seeds to make the things we create and deliver the poorest 2 billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , actually even more important than any other on the planet .
health means that their stocks are not growing over many years . it &apos;s too much , and it &apos;s raining too much , and things will change as their fragile environment cannot withstand .
that leads to success . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to unrest .
so , the climate change will be horrible for you .
the mechanism for them is very important .
the fact is , if you could reduce just one thing , the price is far more effective , by far .
well , the travel community is like time over time .
in fact , the <unk> is based on <unk> .
the <unk> pushed the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a uniform case in the field phase , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , air conditioning , we can create modern materials and do so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s cut the price down -- we hit a new barrier , and that barrier is on co2 .
co2 heats the planet , and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
then they add up the scaling carbon , which leads to the <unk> , and that <unk> has some very negative implications . effects on the weather and maybe worse , the indirectly result that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to such rapid changes and have whole systems .
now , the exact relationship between the stroke and the causes of the net switch , and where the other consequences are , there are some conversations , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these things are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
and i said , &quot; do we really have to go down to close to zero ?
isn &apos;t half or a quarter ? &quot;
and the answer is , until we close to zero , the temperature will continue to continue .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different from saying , we have an eight-foot high truck that has to be under a <unk> bridge , and you can actually crush it underneath it .
this has to go way down , to zero .
well , we run a lot of <unk> every year , over 26,000 billion tons .
every american americans are about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons per person on the planet .
and somehow we need to produce changes that cut this down to zero .
it has been all constant .
there are only different economic changes that have changed at all , and we have to go from 10,000 percent reduction and to zero to zero .
that equation has four factors . a bit of multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that you &apos;re trying to get zero , and it &apos;s dependent on the number of people , the average of the service that every man uses on average , the average energy of every service and the co2 , which is going to be a energy unit .
so let &apos;s look at every factor , and think of how we got it to zero .
probably one of those numbers must get to zero .
now this is basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first , we have the population .
today , 6.8 billion people are .
and it goes to nine billion prescriptions to move to nine billion .
if we can get very successful with new vaccine , which is more competitive and competitive , we could probably reduce that 10 to 15 percent , but right now we can see a slope by 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
it includes everything , the food we eat , clothing , television , heat .
these are very good things and <unk> to make these services accessible to almost everyone on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , at the top billion , we may be able to do <unk> and use less , but on average , this number is going to increase every year and thus , more and more , will be given to more than double , the number of services that per person is provided .
here we see a very basic service , is there light at home so that you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and they read their <unk> under the ground .
well , for efficiency , the e , the energy per service , we finally have some good news .
we have something that isn &apos;t going up .
there &apos;s a lot of services for different successes , by other forms of success , because of new ways of thinking about their energy , there are a lot of services that feed their energy at 90 percent .
in other service , like the manufacturing of <unk> , 105 people : <unk> -- &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
overall , if we &apos;re optimistic , we may get about a factor three or maybe even a factor six .
but for the first three factors , we &apos;ve now gone from 26 billion to 13 billion tons , and that &apos;s just not enough !
so , let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this will be a key -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 per unit unit .
it &apos;s a question of whether you can get this to zero .
when they burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every single source of electricity today is co2 , except renewables and media production .
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need collusion .
now , when i use the term &quot; wonder , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
the internet and its services is a miracle .
people here have contributed to develop many of these miracles .
usually there is no deadline that you need a miracle to a specific date .
normally , you &apos;re just wrong and some come , some people don &apos;t .
but in this case , we have to have <unk> and get a miracle in very short time .
so , i wondered , how can i really get rid of this ?
is there any natural for illustration , a demonstration that &apos;s led to the idea of people here ?
i remembered last year when i got mosquitoes , and somehow people liked it .
the idea became really tangible , you know , that there are people living with mosquitos .
so , for energy this one would hit me .
i decided that would be my favorite contribution to the environment here .
so here &apos;s some natural fireflies .
they told me they don &apos;t bite . they probably won &apos;t even leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of <unk> like this , but they all don &apos;t do much .
we need solutions , either one or more of those to have exquisite and unimaginable dues , and although there are many directions where people are looking for it , i really see only five that can afford these great demands .
i &apos;ve left with tides , <unk> , fusion and biofuels left out .
they may give you a moderate contribution , and if you can afford a better than i expect , it would be great , but my point here is that we have to work on all of those five , and we cannot abandon them because they really have significant problems .
let &apos;s first look at burning fossil fuels , burning from either coal or natural gas .
and what you have to do there seems to be simple , but it &apos;s not . you have to take all the co2 that comes after burning , capture , pressure , put pressure in place and then hoping that it remains there .
there are some charities that can do that on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but get it down to 100 percent , that will be very difficult , and an agreement for cleaning up the co2 is a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is <unk> .
who will make it safe ?
who can guarantee something , which literally has a lot of billions of times larger than any kind of waste you can think of differently and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so that &apos;s a tough place .
next , <unk> .
it also has three big problems : the cost , especially in sub-saharan countries , is high . the question for security that you really feel like nothing can go wrong despite human engagement , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
because , although it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that may be soluble , and that you should be working on .
i &apos;ve summarized the last three of the five .
it &apos;s renewables that are often called the renewables .
and they also -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need a fuel -- they have some drawbacks .
one is the energy density that makes these technologies dramatically lower than current electricity .
these are <unk> , and you talk about many square meters , thousands of times more surface than a normal power station .
and they &apos;re also subject to these sources of surprises .
the sun doesn &apos;t shine all day , it doesn &apos;t seem that every day , and the wind doesn &apos;t shine all the time .
that &apos;s why , if you &apos;re dependent on these sources , you have to have a way of getting the energy in times when it &apos;s not available .
so there are big themes here . there are challenges in the transmission , and if we say the energy source is outside the country , it &apos;s not just technology , you have to deal with the risk of the energy from where you come from .
and there &apos;s the tri-fold .
and to show the dimension , i have all kinds of batteries that are made , looking at the cars , computers , cell phones , out of everything . and that &apos;s what i do with the amount of electronic energy that uses the world to do everything , and i found that all the batteries that we produce now could store less than 10 minutes of the world &apos;s atmosphere .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that will be better for a factor of 100 than the approaches to the time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
this is what happens when you try to get those <unk> sources about , say , 20 percent -- 30 percent of the use .
if you want to rely on 100 percent of it , you need an incredible experience of influence .
now , where should we go , what is the right approach ?
the manhattan project ? how do we get to the target ?
what we need is a lot of companies to work on this . hundreds of them .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
in many people , they say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think there are a lot of people in the ted group who are already engaged in this .
bill ii has a number of companies , among other things , a name that has great leadership .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies making great things , and interesting opportunities , and i &apos;m trying to support that .
nathan myhrvold and i funding a company that , maybe surprisingly , is pursuing the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the bookshop ; modular , liquid .
and development has stopped in this industry a few times ago , so it &apos;s no great surprise that some good concepts lie around .
the health model means you &apos;re instead of burning one percent of the time , the one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the <unk> .
that &apos;s a rather insane idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about this for a long time , but you could never simulate reasonable , whether it would work , but since then there &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it and see that , yes , the right kind of work , it looks like it &apos;s functioning .
and because you burn that 99 percent , it &apos;s much better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can even use the waste of today &apos;s reactors as pathology .
instead of breaking the head , you just burn it . it &apos;s a wonderful thing .
the uranium is incremental used , a bit like a candle .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of column , often known as a primitive wave reactor .
that really solves the world problem .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
that &apos;s waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s burned today , so it &apos;s called <unk> uranium .
this is the chalk for hundreds of years .
and if you zoom in , you can get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges there , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
how should our testimony look ?
well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we have to do , and then we talk about the <unk> .
many talk about 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really , really important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still some farming . hopefully it &apos;s going to be clean and clean to it .
so in order to reach that 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like china , are completely transforming their sourcing communities .
the other note is whether we use the most efficient technology , whether it &apos;s deployed in all the developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great .
this is going to be a key feature .
if we go back from there , what should the 2020 suggest ?
it should have been the two elements again .
we should use the manufacturing techniques to get ourselves on the road , and the less we catch , the less the going to be , and also the temperature .
but in fact , that note for the things that we do don &apos;t fully lead to the large climate change , just the same , or even less importantly than the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
and we have to track these breakthroughs with <unk> , and we can measure this : in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great books on this topic .
al gore book , &quot; we have the choice , &quot; and david <unk> , <unk> energy cut the hot air . &quot;
they really go through and create a framework where this can be discussed broad , because we need support for it .
there &apos;s a lot that needs to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very particular wish for us to invent this technology .
if you just run a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that wish , or i could choose this wish , which is , <unk> <unk> , without co2 , that wish is going to take me .
that has the greatest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the dig between the long and the short term will be terrible , between the united states and china , between poor and rich , and almost all of the lives of those two billion will be much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
what actions do i hire ?
we need to use more for more money .
if countries are meeting in places like youngmenowme , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should discuss these <unk> , and they would be shocked by the ridiculously small funds that are spent for these innovative approaches .
we need cochlear , <unk> &amp; amp ; d networks , something that makes a difference .
we need to spread the news .
we need to be more rational and full and also the things that are being done by government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you !
thank you . just to understand a little bit better -- first of all , can you give us an idea of scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to run the simulation on a supercomputer , all big scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we need just a few 10 million . and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s reasonable , it &apos;s just in the tens of millions of millions .
the difficult step is building the first vessel , finding other billions , the <unk> and the place that actually builds the first one .
and as soon as it &apos;s finished , as i promised you , it &apos;s all very clear , because the economy , the more energy density , is as different from <unk> as we know it .
now , to understand the right thing , that means building deep in the ground almost like a vertical column , of the use of nuclear use , and then the process starts , and is working on the top ?
<unk> : right . so today , you have to redesign the reactor all the time , so there are a lot of people and a lot of control that can go wrong -- this thing where you can open it and get things out there . that &apos;s not good !
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can convert it for 60 years -- think of a column that will bury you without all the complexities .
and it sits down and it burns for 60 years , and then it &apos;s finished .
a nuclear reactor , a nuclear reactor , provides a solution to the waste .
<unk> : yeah . now , what happens to the waste is you can let it sit -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- then take it and put it in the next reactor and keep it going .
and what we &apos;re starting to do is we take the waste that exists already , which is in these <unk> or volume of the reactors . this is our transportation project .
so , what was a problem with these reactors is what we put in our fill with , and it &apos;s going to reduce dramatically dramatically during the process .
but as you &apos;ve talked to various people in the world about these opportunities .
where is the greatest interest , what really makes it work ?
<unk> : well we haven &apos;t yet set ourselves into a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting design opportunities for everything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name , and there &apos;s a lot of interest , and the people of the company there are in russia , india , china -- i was here and talked about how this fits to the <unk> .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , french and japanese did something in the direction .
this is a version of one thing that was done .
that &apos;s a very important step forward , but it &apos;s just like a climbing reactor , and some countries have built this , so everybody who &apos;s done a quick reactor is one for our first .
in your imagination , time time , probability of something really to go into life ?
<unk> : well we need one of those corrosive , <unk> things that are very cheap , we have to invent 20 years to invent and then for 20 years .
that &apos;s kind of the deadline that has proven to show us the <unk> that we need to follow .
and , you know , <unk> , if everything goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , it could be easy .
and luckily , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of them , who , just like their approaches , work for their pilots to be able to do that .
and it would be best if it &apos;s several , because you could use a blend .
but anyway , we need a solution .
reaching the great possible breakthroughs is the biggest one you know about ?
<unk> : an important one is the most important .
it would have been without the oil supply , but it &apos;s still more important to do .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know whose work as well as this , but there &apos;s the modular method , that &apos;s a different approach .
there &apos;s a liquid force that seems a little bit difficult , but maybe they &apos;ll say that about us .
and so there are different things , but the nice thing about it is that there &apos;s a million times a million times as much energy as one , say , a climate change , and therefore , if you can deal with the problems , and these are basically the radiation , the footprint and cost , it plays the potential , so the impact on the land and other things , almost in its own league .
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
do we have the template we &apos;ve had to try and make sure that we &apos;re going to have the cost of stability stable ?
<unk> : when you come to this situation , it &apos;s like having too much food , and you &apos;re just in front of a heart attack , what do you do ? you might need a cardiac surgery or something .
there &apos;s a period of research called <unk> , which deals with various techniques to delay warming , so that we &apos;d be ready for 20 or 30 years for the rest of us .
this is just a double one .
you hope we don &apos;t need it .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t work on insurance , because that might be lazy , so you keep eating on , because you know you &apos;re going to save your heart procedure .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you have to have the importance of this problem in mind , but there &apos;s now a discourse on whether you should have that , if things have to come faster , or take that innovation away than we expect .
leicester : do you have one or two sentences for you to maybe convince you ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately the skeptics live in very different camps .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
do you think there are negative impacts that have to do with the clouds that move things around ?
there are very , very few things you can even say , of which there are a chance in a million .
the problem issue here is similar to aids .
you make the mistake , and you pay a lot later .
and so the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of <unk> problems to invest in something that you only have -- and what comes out is that investment isn &apos;t so clear . in fact , the ipcc isn &apos;t necessarily the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world who are looking at and saying , okay , that &apos;s not a big drama .
the fact is that this uncertainty should make us worry .
but my dream here is that , if you can do it economic , and at the same time you remove the co2 , the skeptics also say , &quot; okay , i don &apos;t know that it doesn &apos;t look like co2 , i just wish it did , but i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be your answer to the <unk> argument that if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals of suffering , the <unk> , the adoption of malaria and so on , that there is a stupid waste of resources to invest money , while there &apos;s better things that we can do .
<unk> : well , the real spending on the research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than you do today -- it &apos;s not that dramatic .
among them , other things don &apos;t suffer .
you get too big sums of money , and you can disagree with reasonable people if you have something that &apos;s not economic and trying to fund that . for me , most of the waste is happening .
unless you &apos;re going to be very , very briefly in front of a training and just funding a learning curve , and i think we need more things that have the potential to be much less expensive .
if the <unk> you get is a very high <unk> , you can only keep up with the rich .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing their lifestyle .
and for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> is thinking .
his new family society is now , &quot; why don &apos;t research be talked more ? &quot;
it &apos;s still associated because of his former stories associated with the general community , but he &apos;s understood that this is a very lonely group , and that &apos;s why he &apos;s now taking the <unk> .
and this is a train i think is appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little it &apos;s being supported .
bill , i think i &apos;m speaking for almost all people here , when i say , i really hope your wish is going to be true . thank you very much .
md : thank you .
a few years ago at ted , peter <unk> asked a <unk> called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
and the idea is pretty simple . in order to build the highest <unk> structure with 20 spaghetti tape , it &apos;s about a meter of tape tape , about meter tape , around a marshmallow .
it &apos;s got to be on top of the marshmallow .
and , although it really seems , it &apos;s really hard to work , because people are pushing very fast .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a feedback scanner .
it was a tremendous success .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 of the world &apos;s workshops , with students , developers and architects , even with <unk> , and there &apos;s something about this task , which brings deep knowledge to the nature of collaboration , and i want to share some of them with you .
and usually most people start to engage themselves with the task .
you talk about it , you &apos;re thinking about what it &apos;s going to look like .
then you spend a little bit of time in planning and organization , drawing and criminal spaghetti .
they invest a lot of their time in the <unk> all the time .
and finally , just before you have no more time , you take the marshmallow , and you gently put it very gently on top of the marshmallow , and you look back at the top , and you admire it .
but what happens , almost all the time , is that this is going to be called &quot; <unk> , &quot; because the weight of the marshmallow causes the weight of the marshmallow to bend and <unk> .
there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; <unk> &quot; than others , and under the worst , fresh water shows .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused , they make really lifelike shapes .
and of course , there are teams that have a lot more &quot; <unk> &quot; and below the best are fresh alumni of the article .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
like us , peter told us not only the biggest towers , but the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be asking is , how is that ? why ? what about those ?
and peter says , &quot; none of the kids spend time to lie to the ceo of spaghetti . &quot;
they don &apos;t spend time in randomness .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that <unk> were trained to find the right plan , ok !
and then realize it .
so what happens when they put the marshmallow on the top , they don &apos;t have time anymore , and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what &apos;s different is that they &apos;ll start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so that they have numerous times the chance to repair structural prototypes .
<unk> recognize this kind of collaboration as a core way to collaboration .
and with each attempt , kids get instant feedback , and what &apos;s not .
so the power is to work with prototypes , major -- but let &apos;s see how different teams do .
the average for most of us is about <unk> , spending half of them , lawyers do a little more , but there &apos;s not much more , much more complex than adults .
who &apos;s the most successful one ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
foot is the highest thing i saw .
and why ? because they understand triangles and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to build robust structures .
ceos are about average . but it &apos;s going to be interesting .
you get an executive administrator on the team , you get significantly better .
it &apos;s amazing . you see around and you recognize , &quot; this team is going to win . &quot;
you can predict . why is that ?
because they have special skills .
they lead the process , they understand it .
and that team , the escape and the work , will significantly improve the performance of the team .
specialized skills and expertise and combination lead to success .
if you have 10 teams , the typical thing , you get about six , you get stable structures .
now i was going to try something out .
and i thought , you know , we &apos;ll put the most vulnerable .
so i offered a $ 40,000 prize for the winners .
what did you think happened to these <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this was what happened . not a team had a robust structure .
if anyone had built high construction , he would have carried the price home .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high climate change has a strong effect ?
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
what do you think happened ?
now understand the advantage of a laser .
it was the best , bad team of one under the best .
they produced the highest construction at the time .
so there &apos;s tremendous lessons for us , about nature and success .
so , you might ask : why would somebody actually spend time to make a sanitary weapon ?
and the reason is , i &apos;m going to use digital tools and processes to help teams create cars , the video games , the visual code .
and what the most common thing is is , it helps them identify hidden assumptions .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge provides a common experience , a common language , or a stance , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in that can come in , you know ?
it &apos;s a blog where you see how you make the marshmallows .
there &apos;s a trickiness there .
you find crazy examples from all around the world , how people optimize the system and optimize it .
they also have suspense .
and the most exciting lesson , i think , is actually a romantic sport .
it requires that we all have our senses on the task , and that we use our thinking intuitively , like our feelings and our actions , in the challenge that is ahead of us .
and sometimes a small prototype of that experience takes us all to take a &quot; <unk> &quot; moment -- to a &quot; <unk> &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
so let &apos;s pretend this is a machine .
it &apos;s a big machine , a cool machine machine , and it &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to go in .
and they can go into the past , they can go into the future ; they can &apos;t stay here and now .
and i wonder what they would choose because i asked my friends a lot more recently , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back in time , or twitter , or &quot; america is looking for the superstar . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that somehow you &apos;re drawn to nostalgia .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of that group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and not because i &apos;m an adventurers .
it &apos;s because the possibilities on this planet don &apos;t go back , they &apos;re going forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that we have ever been on this planet , no matter what scale they are : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining declining .
there never happened to be a time like this .
my family friends died when they were 60 .
so my grandparents urged that number to 70 .
my parents are 80 in heels .
so , there &apos;s better to be nine at the beginning of my twin age .
but it &apos;s not about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child born in new delhi today can be expected to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox gave billions of people on this planet .
they have reinvented the demographics of the earth in a way that no war ever has done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we defeated it . voila .
in the rich world , diseases that have less threatened millions of us before one generation , hardly yet .
index , <unk> , polio ...
does anybody know even what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are successes of the scientific method .
and in my view , the scientific method to explore things is to see if it works , it changes if it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , this is all good news , because there &apos;s a couple of other problems , and they were often mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements a billion people in this world are hungry to sleep every day .
this number goes up , and it goes very fast , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we have used our imagination to disrupt this world properly .
drinking water , water land , rainforests , oil , gas , they disappear , and , soon , if we don &apos;t get out of this chaos , we will go away .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think so .
and i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the country they live on .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t destroy them at the same time .
i think that &apos;s really , and no , it &apos;s not rocket science .
but this keeps me awake at night -- one of the things that keeps me awake at night , and we &apos;ve never really used scientific progress like this now .
and we &apos;ve never been able to make it reasonable , just as we can today .
we &apos;re on the verge of amazing , amazing events in many places , and yet , i really think that we have to go back hundreds and 300 years before the enlightenment to find a time where we &apos;ve been battling progress in these things , in more fronts than we are now .
people are putting up in their faith , and so tightly that they can &apos;t get out of it .
not even the truth will release it .
and listen , everybody has a right to his opinion ; even a right answer to progress .
but you know what they &apos;re not right about ?
they don &apos;t quite pay for their own facts . &apos; sorry , they don &apos;t have it .
and i took a while to figure this out .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccines for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
and i was amazed to impose towards resistance , against what is the most effective health operation in human health &apos;s history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote an article and i went on .
and soon i wrote an article about gamma food .
same thing , just bigger .
people played crazy .
so , i wrote an article on this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought they thought they were , &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they believed that molecules were in a certain rather than a random way of turning an area in nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i went on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we rich , we eat , that &apos;s okay .
but the article made me worry , and i couldn &apos;t find out why , and i figured it out .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics who made me crazy actually weren &apos;t fanatics at all .
these were well-meaning people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that blew me around so ...
but then i thought , you know what , we &apos;re honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as we used to .
we are talking <unk> about it .
we talk ironic , with a little silly quote , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons , and i think we know what the reason are .
we have faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be .
you can just call some names and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , challenger , <unk> , mass destruction , coral destruction .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people we thought they &apos;d always be right . so be skeptical .
ask questions , ask the evidence , demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything for granted .
but here &apos;s it : if you get the evidence , you have to adopt this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
and i can say that because now we live in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen , and hopefully will never see .
about 12 years ago , a story has been published , a terrifying story that brought the answers to measles , <unk> , <unk> vaccine .
very scary .
there were tons of studies done to see if that was right .
there are tons of studies being done ; it &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the u.s. , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all alike , no correlation , no connection , no link .
it doesn &apos;t make a difference . it doesn &apos;t matter , because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see , what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe in a narrow documents of a <unk> that gives us data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
and the result was devastating .
catastrophic because of the fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where immunization goes down .
this is jigme , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
so what happens is that we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because did anyone get measles here ?
has anyone ever seen anybody die of measles ?
not very often happens .
it &apos;s not happening in this country at all , but 160,000 times in the world over the last year .
this is a lot of deaths from measles , 20 per hour .
but because that &apos;s not what happened here , we can displace it , and people like jenny mccarthy can walk around and share messages of fear and illiteracy of platforms like oprah and larry king .
and they can do that because they don &apos;t link cause and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same thing .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
he liberated us from one of the worst human shifts of humanity .
no fear , no fault , republican , compliment , disappeared .
the guy in the middle doesn &apos;t so much .
it &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he &apos;s just evolved with a group of other people .
it can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
it &apos;s pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
well , that &apos;s good , except for paul walk and talking about vaccines , and say how valuable they are , and that people should just stop bitching .
and that actually says that .
so paul is a terrorist one .
when paul talks about a public hearing , he can &apos;t speak without the armed verse .
he gets calls at home because people like to tell him that they know where to go to school .
why ? because paul made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are essential .
if you continue , the diseases go back , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening right now .
we are now measles in this country .
and that &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon , kids are going to die again , because this is just a matter of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die of measles .
what about polio ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
a mine i wrote a few weeks ago , and i said i &apos;m a little bit too sharp .
no one &apos;s ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate the child against polio . no , no way .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio , and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have polio in this country yesterday .
now , i don &apos;t know , maybe this morning someone went into a plane this morning , and he &apos;s flying at los angeles , right now he &apos;s over ohio .
and it ends up in a few hours , and he lands a car , and he comes up to long beach , and he &apos;s going to go to one of the most respected nights tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a paralyzing disease , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s how the world works now .
that &apos;s the planet we live on . don &apos;t pretend it &apos;s not .
we love to covers lies in lies . we love it .
have you all taken your vitamins this morning ?
<unk> , little model of light that helps you on the jumps .
i know you did that because half of americans do it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cures , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out they &apos;re useless .
this data shows this all the time .
they &apos;re eating their urine . they almost never do .
that &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i agree with you .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do it ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the pharma industry .
we hate too much government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our healthcare system is mies .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely cool and refreshing itself that can afford it .
so we walk outside , and where do we go ?
we &apos;re going into the arms of the pri .
that &apos;s great . i love <unk> .
but , you know , it &apos;s a really serious issue , because this stuff is crap , and we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it .
and i &apos;ve got all kinds of little props here .
none of those -- <unk> , cheating , <unk> , cheating , i don &apos;t even even know what that is , but we spend billions of dollars on it , it &apos;s cheating .
and you know what ? when i say that , people scream at me and say , &quot; what do you care ? let people do what you want .
that &apos;s how you feel good . &quot;
and guess what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter to me whether it &apos;s the minister of health that says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to adopt the evidence of my experts , &quot; or some <unk> who wants to treat his patients with <unk> .
if you step on that path , where believe and magic replace evidence and science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to <unk> &apos;s graffiti in south africa .
he killed 400,000 of his people , because he insisted that red food sites , housing sites , housing sites are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs , which we know can break down the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths in a country that &apos;s worse than any other disease being bothered by .
don &apos;t please tell me these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they &apos;ve got them . they always have .
now , the most unlikely epidemic we &apos;re in right now is this absurd battle between the <unk> genetically modified foods and the delivery of inequality .
this is a timely debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , metaphor .
that &apos;s ideology , not science .
everything that we eat , every <unk> , every branch , any branch , is changed by people .
you know , there was no cure in paradise .
there was no motorcade .
we weren &apos;t there . we did all this .
we &apos;ve done it over the last 11,000 years .
and some of that worked , and some of it didn &apos;t work .
we got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
now we can make it more deeply . and of course we do , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and that stuff can help millions of people to extend their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand .
we refuse to have changed food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i hear is all the time : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , gerbils , we don &apos;t want to have large fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want firms to patent .
we don &apos;t want firms to own seeds .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
yeah , you right . we fix that .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge security problem , but that &apos;s not science .
that &apos;s nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right morality , <unk> .
they know science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work because we &apos;re afraid of a real blind end , and it holds millions of people from flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we are right now . 70 percent .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
shame . shame .
you need that , and we don &apos;t give it to you .
and why ? genetically modified foods .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this processed stuff , like cassava .
cassava is something that a half billion people eat .
it &apos;s sort of like a potato .
it &apos;s just a cluster of calories . it &apos;s mies .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have any protein , and scientists are building all this .
and then people might be eating and wouldn &apos;t be blinded .
you wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be off leslie , but it would be nice .
and all i can say is , why do we tackle this ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask : why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want a genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our payload to larger food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice infarction , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to get time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we &apos;re going to keep doing something that is guilty of what we do , i believe we don &apos;t want to be guilty of , you know , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no description for what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s ugly , and we must really stop that .
so after this incredibly fun conversation , you might say , &quot; do you still want to go into this ridiculous machine machine and into the future ? &quot;
definitely . i definitely want to .
now it &apos;s in the present moment , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
we can move them into where we want to move them forward , and we will move them to where we want them .
we need to have these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go into time time and go into the future , we &apos;re going to be happy to have that .
i know that we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , it &apos;s something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
since some time , i &apos;ve been interested in the <unk> , and it seems strange that a magician is interested in it , unless you look at it as i do , as &quot; a delusion that becomes true to something , if somebody believes enough of it . &quot;
in other words , <unk> have shown a measurable impact in some studies , the <unk> , and only because the person thinks what &apos;s happening to her is a pharmaceutical pharmaceutical or a kind of ... in the <unk> , for example , there is if the patient only believes enough of it , a measurable effect in the body called the <unk> body .
a deception is right to something , because somebody senses it like this .
in order to understand each other , i want to show you a basic , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that &apos;s been at least since the 1950s in each case for children .
i even learned it from the <unk> <unk> magic in the 1970s .
i &apos;ll do it for you and then explain .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
so , see what happens .
the knife you can examine ; my hand you can study .
i &apos;m going to just hold the knife like that .
i push my sleeve back .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or out of it , i &apos;m just going to put my wrist right here .
in this way , you can see that no time is going to move anything . as long as i &apos;m drawing there , nothing can go off my sleeve or come out .
and the goal of that is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully if everything goes well , the knife will put through my bare physical magnetism .
in fact , it &apos;s so special in its place that i can shake it , without the knife .
nothing goes into my sleeve or coming out , no barnacles . and they can examine everything .
yay !
now , this is a trick that i often encourage young kids to be honest , because you can learn a lot about deception , if you look closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple thing to do .
now many of you probably know this trick in this room .
it works like this .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i say i shed my wrist to make sure that nothing goes away in my sleeve or coming out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason why i shed my wrist is that there is the real mystery in the illusion .
because at the moment that i put my hand away from you so that you can see it from behind , that finger here , my forefinger , just from where he was , in a position where he was so extended .
amazing trick ?
there &apos;s somebody sitting there who has no childhood .
so , he &apos;s there . exactly .
and when i blink up , the fingers changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that there are only three fingers at the bottom , because the mind and how it process information , it doesn &apos;t matter one , one , two , three , but it &apos;s seen as a pack .
but this isn &apos;t really about this . and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s stuck there , but not by the magnetism of my body , but by a trick , through my index , which is now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens to me is through this movement , that the fingers goes back again .
i &apos;ll take that hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick can present your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with the business problem ?
a year ago or so , i read a study that really blew my mind .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and so that was an amazing thing to me .
so what it turned out is that if you provide a placebo placebo in the form of a white pill , in the form of a nanotube , it &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a slight effect .
but if you are the shape in which you can give it to placebo , for example , in a smaller pill , and you can see that blue color and shape a letter , is actually measurable more effective .
and that , even though none of those pharmaceutical facilities -- it &apos;s just <unk> .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? it really made me freak .
but it turns out that this is not all .
if you take capsules , that &apos;s more effective than the carbonate of any form .
a colored capsule , in one end yellow and other red , is better than a white capsule .
the premium has a role .
a pill twice a day is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistic , i &apos;m sorry .
but the key thing is ...
... that a spider spider has a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you need to reach the needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> substance -- a few <unk> substance with a patient .
it creates a very powerful image in your head . it &apos;s much stronger than a white pill .
this graph is really ... i &apos;ll show you another time , if we have a projector .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t act as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t seem as good as a capsule that does not seem as good as the needle .
and none of it has any really pharmaceutical property , and it &apos;s just our belief that we have in a stronger impact .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i take something that &apos;s obviously a deception , and let it look real .
well , we know from the study that you have to reach your needle when it &apos;s supposed to go .
this is a <unk> long season . it &apos;s very , very rendered , and i &apos;m going to quickly <unk> them a little bit .
this is really my flesh . it &apos;s not <unk> yellow meat .
this is my skin . this is not a big effect in hollywood .
so i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin and pass through it , until she <unk> the other side .
if you &apos;re miserable -- if it &apos;s easily passed out -- i put that in some of my friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and that &apos;s a woman of almost powerless .
so i guess if you &apos;re going to get worse , if you will , for the next 30 seconds , look away , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to make the first sensitive part here .
you can see it in a second , but you can also see if you want .
so , it &apos;s like , right here , where my flesh starts , at the bottom of me , i &apos;m just going to make a little marksman .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you mind that ?
and just sort of get a little bit through my skin and on the other side .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had when we tagged the team .
something .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;ll show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when they see that .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s definitely not so stupid and <unk> himself to talk for a few minutes . &quot;
well , then i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people in the back say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen this right . &quot;
people in the canopy are now coming in .
let me show you a little bit nearby .
this is really my skin . this is not a big effect of hollywood .
this is my flesh , and i can flip this .
sorry . if you &apos;re miserable , look away , don &apos;t look at it .
the people at the back or the ones who see that later on video will say , &quot; well , that looks pretty impressive , but if it were real , he would -- look , there &apos;s a hole and there if it really was real , it would bleed . &quot;
okay , so let me leave you with a little bit of blood for you .
yes , there it is .
now , normally i would take the needle out .
i would clean my arm and show them that there are no lesions .
but i think in this context here and trying to make a illusion from a deception , i &apos;ll just leave the needle in there and walk off the stage .
we &apos;ll see a few more days in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;ll enjoy that . thank you .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
i &apos;ve made some people the number of books that have been published with &quot; happiness &quot; in the last five years , and they spent up about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of variation .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all this tide of work , there are multiple cognitive stats that make it almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly going to be about these cognitive traps .
this is true for grandparents who are thinking about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness because it turns out we &apos;re just as messy as anybody else .
the first of these traps is a healing , complexity .
it turns out that the word is just not a useful word anymore because we apply it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a particular meaning that we could limit , but in large and large , is something we need to give up , and we &apos;re going to have to adopt the complicated view of what is well-being .
the second trap is a false act of experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s between happy in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both darwinians in the idea of happiness .
and the third one is the most inspiring , and that is the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about a situation that affects well-being without causing its meaning .
i mean , this is a really cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , for example , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who reported a story after one of my lectures , who reported a story , and &#91; unclear ... &#93; he said he had heard a symphony , and it was absolutely gorgeous music , and at the end of the recording , there was a <unk> ringing sound .
and then he added , really , really emotional , that ruined all the experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it ruined was the memories of experience .
he had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of <unk> music .
they didn &apos;t follow because he was exposed to a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he got to keep it .
what this really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and other people in terms of two types of self .
there &apos;s an environmental self that lives in the present and knows the present , able to experience the past , but basically has the present .
it &apos;s the most devastating self that the doctor knows -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt if i put you here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s an environmental self , and the most important self is that the estimating and the history of our lives is preserved , and it &apos;s the one that appeals to the doctor by saying , &quot; how have you felt lately ? &quot;
or &quot; what was your journey to albania ? &quot; or something .
these are two very different units that have the potential self and the potential self , and to confuse the two is part of the value of the name of happiness .
now , the <unk> self is a storyteller .
and that really starts with a basic response to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we &apos;re not just talking stories when we &apos;re doing stories about telling stories .
our memory tells us stories , which is to say , what allowed us to maintain our experiences is a story .
and let &apos;s take an example with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients who are doing a painful procedure .
i won &apos;t go into it . she &apos;s not painful these days , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report every 60 seconds about her pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who &apos;s suffered more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b has suffered more . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they suffered ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient has a much worse health response to the <unk> , as a patient b .
the stories of <unk> were different , and because a critical part of the story is how it ends .
and none of these stories are very promiscuous or great -- but one of them is that clear ...
but one of them is far worse than the other .
and the worse one , where the pain was at the very end of its peak . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know ?
because we asked these people about their <unk> , and much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing overall ? &quot;
and it was much worse for a b than b in the coalmine .
now , this is a direct conflict between self itself and itself .
from the point of view itself , b had definitely been an worse time .
now , what could be done with patient a , and we have actually done clinical trials , and it &apos;s been made , and it works , and it would actually work , you know , the patient &apos;s worth of the patient just by simply pushing the tube in too much .
that will lead the patient to be suffering , but a little less and less than before .
and if you do that for a few minutes , what you have done is that the welfare self is a little bit worse from the patient , and it &apos;s made that the welfare self is a much better off , because now you have an patient a better story on your experience .
what constitutes a story ?
and that &apos;s true of the stories that the memory provides us , and it also applies to the stories that we invent .
and so one story of a story is zilch , relevant moments and ends .
in the end , very , very important , and in this case , dominated the end .
well , the ottoman self itself lives forever .
it &apos;s got moments of the gharial , one at one time .
and you say , what happens to those moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they are forever lost .
i mean , most moments of our lives -- and i do end up with this -- you know , the psychological moment is in about three seconds , which means , you know , there &apos;s about 600 million of them in a lifetime . in a month , there &apos;s about 600,000 . most of you leave no trace .
most of them are completely ignored by their own self self .
and yet , somehow , you kind of get the sense that you should count , that what happens during that period of time is our lives .
it &apos;s the finite resource that we use while we are in the world .
and how we would be using it may be important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the sharing sharing for us .
so we have the reckless self and the breathing self itself , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is a bridge .
from the perspective of the <unk> itself , if you have a vacation and the second week is just as good as the first week , then the <unk> vacation is twice as good as the <unk> vacation .
that &apos;s not how it works at all .
for the sake itself , a <unk> vacation is barely better than the <unk> vacation , because there &apos;s no new memories .
you didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that is different from a <unk> itself itself , and it has very little impact in that story .
well , the continued self makes more than remembering and telling stories .
it &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient who , if you have a patient , had two different surgeons and decide which to vote , that &apos;s the select that the memory has , which is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon who &apos;s chosen .
the <unk> itself has no voice in that choice .
actually , we don &apos;t choose between experiences , we choose between the memories of experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t normally think of our future as any experiences .
we think about our future as adaptive memories .
and you can basically look at this , you know , as an tyranny of the fittest itself , and you can think of the self as one , which is sort of the <unk> self through experiences that doesn &apos;t need the growth itself .
and i have the impression that if we &apos;re on vacation , this is a very common case , that means we &apos;re mostly on holiday for itself in the service itself .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we interfere from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the association itself .
and when i think about it , i think of a vacation that we &apos;ve done a few years ago on antarctica , which is clearly the best vacation i had ever had , and i think , quite often , in relation to how often i think of other people &apos;s minds .
and i &apos;ve probably got my memories on that long trip , i would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i ever opened the folder with the 600 pictures , i would have spent another hour .
well , that &apos;s three weeks , and it &apos;s only one and a half hours .
there seems to be a disagreement .
now , i might be extremely extreme , you know , how little appetite i have on the confluence of memories , but even if you make more of it , there &apos;s a real question . why do we give memories so much weight in the amount of weight that we experience ?
so i want you to think about a thought thought .
imagine your next holiday , you know , that at the end of the day , all of your pictures are crushed , and you get an extra drug , so you will remember nothing .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you were to choose another holidays , there &apos;s a conflict between their two selves and you have to think about how they choose this conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious at all , because if you think of time in the sense of time you get an answer . and if you think of memories in mind , you could get a different answer .
so why we choose the <unk> , which we choose to choose is a problem that has choices between the two types of self .
now , the two types of self are actually two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per person .
so you can ask : how happy is this personal self itself ?
and then you would ask , how happy are the moments in the life of personal self ?
and they &apos;re all -- fortunately for moments is a rather complicated process .
so what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea of happiness from happiness itself over time .
if you ask about the happiness of the personal self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
it &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or delighted the person is when that person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
anyone who &apos;s not different about these terms is going to screw the exploration of happiness , and i &apos;m involved in a lot of researchers who &apos;ve messed up the exploration of happiness in this particular way .
the distinction between happiness itself and happiness has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two separately .
the gallup organization has a worldwide survey , where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and their experiences , and there was other effort in the direction .
so in the last few years we &apos;ve started to learn about the happiness of the two species of ourselves .
and the most fundamental lesson that i think we &apos;ve learned is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone is with his life , and that doesn &apos;t really teach you a lot about how happy he lives and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the relationship , the correlation is about empowerment .
what that means is , if you were to hit somebody , and you would say , oh , his dad is a <unk> , how much would they know about his size ?
well , you &apos;d know something about his height , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
when i tell you that somebody has their life as eight on a scale of 10 amputees , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his <unk> himself .
so the correlation is narrow .
we know a little bit about what &apos;s wired to happiness &apos;s happiness .
we know money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is mostly about being happy with people we like time to spend time with people we like .
there &apos;s other pleasure , but that &apos;s a dominant issue .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two types of self , you will end up doing very different things at the end .
so the implication of what i &apos;ve been saying here is that we really don &apos;t think of happiness as a substitute for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , very briefly , one of the reasons we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things when we think about life , and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question about how happy people in california are not going to get the correct answer .
if you ask this question , people in california have to be happier if you , say , in ohio .
and what happens is , when you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference , we say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for itself itself , and it &apos;s not even very important for the thoughtful self that decides how happy people are .
well , because the thoughtful self is responsible , you can at the end -- some people could go to california at the end .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to see what happens to people who are moving to california in hope to be happier .
well , your funeral self becomes not going to be happier .
we know this .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , you &apos;re going to be reminded of how horrible the weather was in ohio , and you feel you &apos;ve made the right choice .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ve given you a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , as we were talking about a couple of weeks ago , they told me that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came out of this at the time poll .
is this something that you can assist us , because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting thing we &apos;ve found at the gallup survey is a number that we didn &apos;t expect to find .
and we found that in terms of the happiness of the self itself .
when we were looking at how feelings vary with income .
and it turns out , under the income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a very representative sample under $ 600,000 dollars a year in a year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year are people unhappy , and they become increasingly happier , the poorer they get .
and we get this absolutely flat line .
i mean , i &apos;ve rarely seen flat lines .
what &apos;s obvious is that it doesn &apos;t raise money , but that lack of money , surely , raise misery , and we can measure very , very clearly .
in the spirit of the other self , the self self , they get another story .
the more money you make , you &apos;re happier .
that &apos;s not for emotion .
but danny , the whole american effort is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
when people take this finding seriously , i mean , it just seems to turn everything down , all we believe in terms of tax tax and so on .
is there a chance for politicians to take the country to generally take evidence of the seriousness and make it based on politics ?
<unk> : you know , i think there &apos;s recognition for the role of preservation in politics .
the recognition will be slowly in the united states , no question , but the uk is happening , and in other countries , it &apos;s happening .
people are starting to acknowledge that they should be thinking of happiness when they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to be a while , and people are going to debate whether or not they want to study trials , or whether they want to study information studies , so we have to get this discussion pretty soon .
how you increase happiness is very different depending on how you think and whether you think about the consumer yourself , or whether you think about the consumer yourself .
that will affect policy , i think , in the coming years .
in the united states , you start to measure the population of the population .
that will be , i think , in the next decade or two of the national statistics .
now , it seems to me , this subject , or should at least be the most exciting political debate for pursuing the next couple of years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny seligson .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in reality as it is to save .
i have a plan for that . i want to convince more people , including all of you , spend more time with play more and more fun games .
currently we spend three billion hours a week with <unk> .
some of you may be thinking , this is a lot of time for games .
maybe a little too much time when you think about how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
but in fact , according to my research at the institute of the future , it &apos;s just opposite to it .
three billion hours a week aren &apos;t nearly nearly enough to solve the most compelling problems in the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we &apos;re going to survive the next century on this planet , we have to dramatically increase this time .
i &apos;ve calculated that it took time at 21 billion hours playing time per week .
that might seem a little bit more ambitious , so i repeat it to make it work : if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity , i think we need to try and play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to the end of the next decade .
no , i mean really serious .
why ? this image really describes why i believe games are so critical for survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of the photographer phil <unk> .
he wanted to catch the feelings of play , so he built a camera before the players .
this is one of the classic words in play .
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe some of the nuances are in this picture .
you &apos;re probably looking at this sense of urgency , a little bit of fear , but also thrilled , really deepened into solving a really difficult problem .
if you &apos;re playing , you see some of the nuances here , looking up , and the mouth is a sign of optimism , and the eyebrows are in surprise .
this is a player that stands at the edge of what &apos;s called the epic alchemist .
oh , you know that . ok . fine . so we have some players here .
a <unk> victory is a result that is so incredibly positive that they didn &apos;t know it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you do , they &apos;re shocked to actually be able to do that . this is a <unk> victory .
this player is a little malcolm victory .
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces around the world , if we take the barriers of the next century , the face of people who are against all odds on the verge of a epic crocodile .
well , unfortunately , we tend to see that face in real life , when we face hard problems .
i refer to it as &quot; in life i &apos;m bad , &quot; and it actually is my face , you see ? ok ? ok .
this is me doing a bad job , &quot; in life i do bad . &quot;
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied why we are better than real life .
that &apos;s a problem that many players have .
we think that in reality we &apos;re not as good as playing .
and not only do i mean less successfully , though it is .
we get more and more involved with the motivation of doing something meaningful , inspired to collaboration with each other .
if we are in a research group , i think a lot of us are going to turn into our best version , anytime at any given time , to be helpful , to try to solve the problem as long as we need to try it once again .
and in reality , if we fail , when we run on obstacles , we often feel ourselves differently .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated , neglect .
and we never have these feelings when we play games , they just don &apos;t exist .
and that &apos;s what i was looking at as a graduate student .
why is play impossible in play to think , you couldn &apos;t just achieve everything ?
how can we transfer these feelings into reality ?
so i looked like the world of warcraft offering the ideal environment for collaborative problem-solving .
and i noticed some things that can harvest the epic winds in <unk> .
now , first of all , if you &apos;re going to get in one of these online games , particularly in world of warcraft , there are a lot of different characters that are ready to give you a <unk> mission , and it &apos;s immediately .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfect at your current level , right ?
so they do that .
you never get a job you can &apos;t fix .
but always on the edges of it , you have to do it , but you have no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and turns out . you &apos;re always doing something important .
and there are tons of employees .
wherever you go , hundreds of thousands of people working together to finish their epic mission .
and we don &apos;t have that easy in real life , that feeling that there are tons of staff in there .
there &apos;s also this epic story , this inspiring story , why we &apos;re there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve heard about &quot; level high &quot; and &quot; + 1 strength &quot; or &quot; + 1 power . &quot;
that constant feedback doesn &apos;t exist in real life .
when i leave that stage , i don &apos;t have one thing to do : add 1 and a crazy idea , a + 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get that feedback in real life .
so , the problem of <unk> like the world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to stand at any given at any given on the edge of a epic epic , that we would rather be spending all our time in those areas of life .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all the world of <unk> have spent millions of years trying to solve the virtual problems of climate change .
that &apos;s not necessarily bad .
it sounds nice .
but in the context of seeing this in context , tens of thousands of years ago , our first offshore study began to stay upright .
so the first in my primate .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend playing with play , it just makes sense when you think about the scale of human development in terms of magnitude of human development , which is extraordinary .
but also very appropriate , because it turns out , by using all this time on play , we actually change what we &apos;re capable of as people .
we turn to collaborative thinking , so creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe that .
and if you look at this interesting statistic , which was published recently from a researcher from carnegie mellon university , the average young man of today in a country with severe levels of congress has aged 10,000 hours of age with <unk> to 21 hours old .
so , 10,000 hours is an extremely interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , there are the exact basic sum bills they spend in school , from the fifth grade to high school , if you never miss .
so here we have a complete regularity here where young people are learning what it means to be a good player , like anything else they learn in school .
and maybe some of you have read the new book by malcolm gladwell , &quot; <unk> , &quot; read .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of the science revolution , that if we spend 10,000 hours with the degree of any matter of any matter to the 21st of 21 , we &apos;re going to master it .
we &apos;re going to be so good at whatever the most significant people in the world do .
so , what we have here is a entire generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , what exactly is player doing good ?
because if we could find that out , we &apos;d never have ever been there ever since , ever , ever designed human potential .
so many people we have right now in the world that spend at least one hour a day with a deadline .
this is our <unk> . 500 million people , extraordinarily good in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade we &apos;ve got another billion , which is extraordinarily good either .
in case you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
there &apos;s an environmental approach that &apos;s designed to save energy and work on <unk> , instead of <unk> , so that players can play around the world , especially in india , china , brazil .
you expect an extra billion player in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion users .
so i started thinking about what it is that these games are going to master us .
here are the four things i found . first of all , <unk> .
ok , think of this as extreme <unk> .
<unk> is desire to do something immediately , to master , to believe that we have a lead hope for success .
players always believe that a <unk> victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying to do it , which is the same .
gamers don &apos;t sit around .
gamers are masters of the spiders of social nets .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show us that we like people , after playing with them , even when they &apos;ve defeated evil .
the reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone .
we trust that there is time to spend time with us that the rules will be honored that we have the same goal and keep up to the end of the concert .
so this allows for daylight to grow and trust and with each other .
as a result , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
so , you know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> of four hours a week is playing at 22 hours a week .
the reason is , when we play , we &apos;re actually happier at working hard , than if we &apos;re to relax or nothing .
we know that we work as human beings , if we do hard , meaningful work .
and gamers are always ready to work hard if they get the right job .
and finally , the epic matter .
players love to become part of awe <unk> missions .
here &apos;s an information perspective to put that in the right light . you know all wikipedia , the largest <unk> in the world .
the second largest shield in the world , with almost 80,000 <unk> , is the world of warcraft wiki .
five million people use it every month .
they compiled more information about world of warcraft in the internet than any other item in the world .
they &apos;re creating a epic story .
they &apos;re creating a epic resource of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers leading to one outcome : players are predictable , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world as one .
and the only problem is that you think you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real thing .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward orientalism is a <unk> .
his work is brilliant . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in teams of money .
and he says , &quot; we are being witnessing not less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and this is an economist , so it makes sense .
and he says ...
not as i am making -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little more nerdy .
so he says that actually makes sense , because players can achieve more than real life .
they can tie stronger social ties than in real life . they get more feedback and reward in games than real life .
so , he says it &apos;s at the moment of complete logical that gamers are more in the virtual world than in real time .
i agree , that makes sense .
but it &apos;s definitely not definitive .
we need to start transforming the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that lasted 2,500 years .
these ancient cubes , <unk> , you know ?
in front of these fabulous bedfellows , there were hypertext comics .
and that was kind of the first of humans developed .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the stuff of the ancient greek <unk> <unk> , you may know that story . the story about how and why games have been invented .
according to noise games , games , more stately , are invented in the kingdom during a famine .
there was such a great famine that the king of <unk> decided to go to a crazy idea .
the people were upset . people were fighting .
it was an extraordinary situation . it was an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to <unk> , the bus minister and wounded became a national strategy . one day you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they were going to be so wiser in the classroom , because games are so fascinating and given us with <unk> , <unk> productivity , that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat .
and for so many years , they survived this famine for 18 years by eating and playing on one day .
in the same way , i think we &apos;re going to put games today .
we &apos;re doing games to escape the suffering of the real world .
we &apos;re going to play games to avoid everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , all of which is not satisfying in real life , and we &apos;re going to get ourselves out of play .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
so that &apos;s the exciting thing .
after 18 years , the famine was not better in 18 years , so the king decided to take a last <unk> .
they divided the kingdom in two halves .
they played a <unk> , and the winner were allowed to disrupt a epic adventure .
they went out and they were looking for a new home , leaving as many people as they were going to survive , looking for the rest of the food in which they could thrive .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but recent surveys show that the <unk> , which ended up the roman empire later , have the same dna as the old <unk> .
so scientists have recently come to the notion that beethoven &apos;s crazy story actually is true .
and geologists found evidence of global cooling , which could explain what the famine could explain .
so this crazy story might be true .
you may actually have saved your people through play by 18 years in games , and then they had these <unk> and they learned so much about each other that they had saved all the civilization .
so , we can .
we &apos;ve been playing since 1994 kerry .
this was the first inquiry in real time of <unk> . it was 16 years ago .
they played this for 18 years , and we &apos;ve been playing orcas for 16 years .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own personal game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to look for a new world , and so i &apos;m going to take my 21 billion followers a week .
we should decide that half of us spend a day playing with play every day until we solved the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems in the real world ? &quot; and that &apos;s exactly how i &apos;ve devoted my work to the future in the last few years .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , suggesting how we ought to understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to make the best possible outcome , and then empower people to make this idea into reality .
we imagine epic hydro and give people the ways to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you very quickly three games i &apos;ve designed to try and get people &apos;s epic preserve in their own future .
this is &quot; the world without oil . &quot;
the game is in 2007 .
it &apos;s a cold-water machine where you &apos;ve got to get through a college conference .
the idea is invented , but we have enough healthcare tools for them to be realistic for them , and they literally live their real lives . so , if you go to the game , tell us where you live . and then you get <unk> in real time that you show how much oil costs , what you don &apos;t have , how food is closed , how food is closed , is whether schools are closed , is whether schools are closed , whether schools are closed , whether schools are closed , whether or not there
we tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been covering it since over the last three years .
and i can tell you it was a changing experience .
nobody wants to change their lives because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a epic adventure and said , &quot; we &apos;re out of oil . &quot;
this is a fascinating adventure you go .
find out how they survive , and most of our players have wired them in play habits .
so for the next positive computer game , we have a bigger , more focused goal than we do .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; connected &quot; at the institute of the future .
the calculation of a supercomputer is that people have only 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called the &quot; global guided principle , &quot; of course .
the call to player , to pull , is we &apos;ve made almost like a <unk> <unk> pattern .
you know jerry <unk> , where they have the &quot; <unk> &quot; -- they have the astronauts , the scientists , the <unk> , and they can only save the world .
but in our game , instead of just 5 people , we say everyone is in the <unk> , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
eight hundred weeks playing the game playing .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions you can read when you google &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and the last game we have on march 3 , which is a play with the world bank .
when you finish the game , you get from the world bank &apos;s award to &quot; social promotion , &quot; 2010 .
we work with students all across sub-saharan africa , and invite them to learn social redesign .
we have a comic dollar to that . we have the level of the level , to understand , to understand , to understand , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i &apos;d like to invite you all to share this game with young people , all over the world , especially in business groups that benefit from presenting their own social enterprises to save the world .
i &apos;m going to end up .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we don &apos;t have saved the real world .
well , i hope that it reminds me that gamers are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a great meaning for change .
we have all these superpowers , painstaking productivity , the ability to tinker with tight social nets , nurturing and desire for fundamental meaning .
i really hope that we play big games to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you will design and play with me like this .
if i go to the next decade , i &apos;m sure for two things that we can create any additional future , and that we can play all sorts of games .
so i say , let the <unk> games begin !
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about a few months ago writing an article for wired wired .
i always do my writing with writing , but i was finishing up with the text process , and i noticed that i had never looked up in my life , what the word &quot; disabled &quot; really means .
i &apos;ll read you the point .
&quot; disabled , &quot; <unk> : &quot; forced , helpless , useless , destroyed , forced , wounded , wet , battered , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , impotent , <unk> , <unk> senile , <unk> , refrigeration , broken , counted , <unk> , broken , broken , breaks , counted , <unk> , and weak .
<unk> : healthy , strong , commitment . &quot;
i read this list of a friend , and i had to make sure that it didn &apos;t work so ridiculous , but i just came until &quot; beaten &quot; and i had to stop reading , and i had to stop reading and i had to stop reading and take emotional shock .
of course , it was a <unk> , old art problem , and i thought that the issue was pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy in the early &apos; 80s when i started to elementary school , and it began to build my sense of self outside of my family context and form , even in terms of other children and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god i used no use at the time .
so if i were to take this shot seriously , i would be born in a world that someone like me would be aware of , whose lives can &apos;t be positive at all , but today i &apos;m going to celebrated the opportunities and the adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
so , immediately , i put in the middle of 2009 , and i expected me to find a more important contribution here .
this is the titanic version of this consortium .
unfortunately , she isn &apos;t much better .
i particularly shake the last two words under &quot; near wilderness , &quot; &quot; near <unk> &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just words .
it &apos;s what we think about people we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language shapes how we think and how we see the world around us .
many ancient societies , including the greek and the romans , did really believe that the approval of the election has a lot of strength , because what they were suggesting can also manifest themselves .
so , what do we actually demonstrate -- a disabled person , or a healthy person ?
even to mention a human being as a child , it might be enough to counter , and to give you ideas about it .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open up your doors ?
a human being opened for me for the doors was my pediatrician at <unk> dupont institute in <unk> .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> whose name , as you can imagine , most americans couldn &apos;t do correctly . so he was always called dr. p. .
and dr. p. was always wearing colorful colorful and was just created for the work with kids .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my <unk> .
i &apos;ve had to do one thing for an infinite amount of work on an infinite amount of time with this big , elastic <unk> -- in different colors -- and i hated those clicks more than anything . i hated it . i hated it . i hated it .
and just imagine , i &apos;ve even touched with dr. p. a kid , and so tried to stop this practice , without success .
and one day , he was watching me at one of my photographic efforts -- these practices were just tiring and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;ll one day of one of those clicks .
and if you can do it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
now , of course , this was just a simple trick from dr. p. , so i &apos;m making the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do , with the prospect that the richest five girls are going to be in the second floor , but he actually made me see my daily <unk> with new eyes , so it became a new and varied experience .
and i wonder today , how much his vision of myself as strong and powerful young girls had shaped my sense of self , and i could imagine as one of nature &apos;s inherently powerful , powerful and empowered human being .
this is just one example of many , like adult adults , who can make a child &apos;s imagination .
but as the theoretical examples of the theoretical world show us , our language has no room to imagine what we all wish would be : to enable anyone to see themselves as a healthy person .
our language expresses the social changes that have been triggered in many cases through technological change .
so , from the medical standpoint , of course , what you can say is that my legs , the <unk> of <unk> , ranging from titan and al power for aging body , which allow people to really use their opportunities and spread across the borders that brought them to natural destiny , not to speak of social social resources , in their own way , not to have a social identity , in their own way , and orient themselves to groups that are choosing themselves .
so maybe this technological change will explain more clearly than ever , that there was always another truth , that every human being in society can give something very profound and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt , to adapt , is our biggest plus .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people are always asking me to tell me about how i deal with odds , and i will tell you something , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable to answer the questions of people , and i think , gradually , i understand why .
this line of dealing with adversity lives on the idea that success or happiness depends on solving a challenge , without being shaped by the very associated experience , as if my life was so successful , because i could dodge the possible falling of a life with a prosthetic limb , or whatever people can do with my disability .
but the truth is that we are changing . of course , we are inspired by the challenge , whether it &apos;s physically , emotionally , or even both .
and i want to suggest that that &apos;s good .
odds are not a barrier that we need to anticipate to come up with our lives .
hesitation are part of our lives .
and i tend to see odds as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s barely sighted , but it &apos;s constantly with me .
and i don &apos;t want to have the impact in the end of the impact of a human being .
there are diagnoses and challenges in life , and they are just absolutely real real , and each person is doing it , but the question isn &apos;t whether we seem to be at odds or not , but how we get there .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for that , the people we love to do in front of us , but also prepare for them to get good at it .
and we don &apos;t make a liking to our kids if we feel that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to separate two things : to one that is the medical fact , to be amputated , and to the rest of the social opinion of whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and heightened disability that i &apos;ve had to share with each other is that the world is constantly thinking that it can be described with these definitions .
in our desire to protect the people who care about our hearts and to give them the cold hard truth about their medical forecast , or even a forecast to the quality of life that she &apos;s expecting , we need to be careful that we don &apos;t put on the basis of being disabled .
perhaps this is the now concept that just looked at what &apos;s going on in the process , and how we repair the repair for each one of the more than pathology groups .
if we don &apos;t treat people relativity , and we can &apos;t perceive all its forces and opportunities and acknowledge , in addition to the natural struggle you may need , one more disease .
we hired a person who has value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the surface patterns and focus on all of human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between perception of our fortunes and our great educational system , a connectivity .
we should not deny or deny these positive times , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid it , nor should we move them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about recognizing the odds of opportunity .
i think it &apos;s a bit more like that , to make sure that we don &apos;t necessarily have to get over dissent , but we &apos;re open to taking them , embracing them , trying to use them , and maybe even dancing with it .
and maybe we can , to look at odds as something natural , coherent and useful , and feel like we don &apos;t feel so bothered by their presence .
in that year , we celebrate 200 . the birthday of charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , in my view , said in something very real in the human character .
i would call it like this : not the most powerful of its species , but not the other nature of its species , but the way that changes can adapt to the best .
of conflict , creativity emerges .
not just from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of people to survive and to survive , the struggle of the human mind , is to turn through conflict .
so again , change and adaptation is the great ability of man .
and maybe we only know where wood we &apos;re suspended when we really are tested .
perhaps that is the sense of dissent , a perception of the past , a sense of our own strength .
we can give ourselves a little closer to ourselves .
we can discriminate a new meaning that goes beyond severe times .
maybe we can see diagnoses as a change .
strangeness are a change we haven &apos;t found yet .
i think the biggest damage we made ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
let &apos;s face it -- who &apos;s normal ?
there is no normal one .
there &apos;s the usual one . the typical . but not the normal , and would you really learn this poor , gray person if you really existed ?
i don &apos;t think so .
it would be great if we could make this paradigm paradigm , against one of the possibilities or strength , to actually formulate it a little bit more dangerous , and we can inform the forces of very many children , and invite them to bring their special and valuable skills into society .
needless to have found that we have always ruled people from members of our society to be useful and contribute to a contribution .
there is evidence that the neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , have carried older people and people with severe physical injuries , and that might happen , because the wisdom in the long-term survival of these people was valuable .
they didn &apos;t have these people broken and useless ; they were being treated as something special and valuable .
a couple of years ago , i was growing up in the city where i grew up , in the red zone in this red zone in the northeastern of pennsylvania , and i was in front of a vicious tomato .
it was summer and i finished .
and i hear a guy saying , &quot; if this is not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i turn around , and i see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ourselves ? i don &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you can &apos;t remember me .
when i first saw her , i got her from her mother &apos;s gut . &quot;
oh , so the one .
and then , of course , it made the click .
this was dr. <unk> , a man that i just knew from narratives of my mother that day , because i , of course , was very late to my birthday two weeks .
my mother &apos;s medical medical adviser was on vacation , and my parents knew the man who brought me to the world , not at all .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet had been looking down for them , and i had just some toes on this one and some toes on the other side , he was the <unk> , that strangers had to give the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and never be as respected as other children , or that you could never lead an independent life , and since then they just made me hate lying . &quot;
what i found was , really extraordinary , that he had collected the entire childhood of my entire childhood , whether i &apos;d won with a <unk> in the second grade , whether i had been in the second grade at the bottom of the day , whether i had lost my scholarship or one of my athletic generators , and he used these snippets to teach his students , and he used these clips to teach his students , <unk> medical school and medical school .
and he called that part of his case the x factor , the potential of human will .
you can &apos;t just emphasize enough how significant this factor can be for human life .
and dr. comer said , he said , &quot; i learned that children , if they don &apos;t always say anything else , and even if they get a little bit of support , children can do a lot . &quot;
you see , dr. <unk> changed his thinking .
he understood that medical diagnosis , and how someone handle it , are two different things .
and also , i think , over time , if you were wondering me at the age of 15 , if i &apos;d activate my prosthetics against meat and bones , i would have won &apos;t have a second .
i was really longing to be normal at the time .
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and that &apos;s what happens because i have experienced my legs and not in spite of that experience .
and perhaps that change could happen , because i &apos;ve met so many people open to the doors , instead of looking at people who would embrace me or give me an idea .
see , it really requires one person to show you how they can manifest their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to turn their own inner power , the human mind is so versatile -- if you can do that , and for someone in a critical moment , you open a door , you &apos;re a very good teacher for these people .
they teach them to open the doors .
the real meaning of predicting &quot; guided &quot; in the word &quot; lifestyle . &quot;
it means to produce something that is in one , the potential to continue .
again , what kind of potential do we want to train ?
in the 1960s , one case of the u.k. was done in the u.k. , and then they were transformed in <unk> .
they call this &quot; user-generated tithers &quot; in the united states , we call it &quot; fingertips . &quot;
the students are divided by grades .
and the a students are tested harder for the better teachers , and so on .
they have been given a <unk> period of time with a &quot; not &quot; the grade , &quot; they were told they were very smart , and they were really smart after these three months .
and of course , it shone to you to hear the heart that the <unk> was told , they were just sufficient .
and it was like that after three months .
but only those who were in school , apart from the students who had beaten the school .
and what was really important about this trial was that teachers weren &apos;t locked up .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they were just told that they were the students , and that the students are enough with the grade , and they also taught them something and they were treating them .
the only real disability is a broken mind , a mind that has broken , has no hope anymore . he &apos;s missing the natural , <unk> <unk> and our innate ability of imagination .
but if we can continue to support the human spirit in this , continue to hope , to continue , and to find other people around them , to be curious and to be funny , and then we really put our powers very positive .
if a mind has these qualities , we can create a new reality and new organizational technology .
i &apos;d like to finish with a poem , which was written by a persian poet called <unk> in the 14th century , and the poem is called &quot; the god who knows only four words . &quot; &quot; every child knows god , not the god of the name , not the god of the god , but the god who knows only four words and repeatedly , he always says , &quot; come dance with me . &quot;
come , dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better than you are at the moment ?
suppose i said that through few changes of your genes , you could have a better memory -- more precise , more precise and faster .
or do you want to be more polite , more power .
would you like to become more attractive and more confident ?
what about living for longer living in good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who has always been yearning for more creativity .
which one would you like the most ?
which one would you like to have if you could just have one ?
creativity .
how many people would vote creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a couple . probably about as many people there are .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would decide for a good memory ?
a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i loved that as a doctor .
if you could have one of those , it would be a very different world .
is this all a fantasy ?
or is it possible ?
and evolution has been a serious topic here at ted , but today i want to give you the point of a doctor &apos;s perspective .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was also a <unk> in the russian orthodox church , once wrote an essay called &quot; nothing in biology makes sense of the light of evolution . &quot;
now , if you are one of those who can &apos;t accept the proof of biological evolution , that would be a very good time when you get rid of your mind , and you take the permission -- i give you the permission -- and maybe you can take a look at kathryn schultz &apos; book , which is to be wrong , because there &apos;s nothing else that &apos;s going to make any sense for you .
but if you accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
does it matter to others , or is it dependent in us ?
this is another looking at the tree of life .
in this picture , i &apos;ve put a bush in the middle of the branches in all directions , because if you look at the margins of life , if you look at the margins of the tree in evolutionary terms in evolutionary terms , they had to survive ; it has pointing its environment and pointing its environment .
the human part of this increase , far at the end , is of course what we &apos;re most interested in .
we separate from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in that period of time , maybe 20 or 25 different species of hominids were from hominids .
some of them have come and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about 480,000 years .
it seems that we are very remote remote from the other parts of life , but for the most part , the basic mechanisms of our cells are pretty much the same .
you realize that we can take advantage of it and the mechanisms of a common bacterium to produce the protein of the human network , which is used to treat the diabetic molecule ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein as a chemically symbol of what comes out of the pancreas .
and as we talk about bacteria , you know that every one of us in our gut is more bacteria than it &apos;s going to lead to cells in the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times as many .
i mean , do you think when antonio damasio asks the exact same thing , think about bacteria ?
our gut is a perfectly accurate environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s circular , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to all be giving them all the nutrients they could just want to do without endeavor .
it &apos;s a really easier road to bacteria , with occasional decay of the professional professional , refusing forced hunting .
but else , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they are important for their lives .
they help use essential nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what &apos;s going to come in the future ?
are we in some kind of evolutionary equilibrium in the form of species ?
or are we certainly to be something else -- something that may even be adapted to the environment ?
now let &apos;s take a step back in the big bang of the big bang 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signs of living organisms , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first variety of organisms , perhaps much more than 800 or a billion years ago -- and then the human species , which shapes in the last 10 year years .
in this huge unfinished symphony of the universe , life on earth is only for a moment ; the animal kingdom , like a single stroke , and of human life , is a little <unk> .
we were .
this is also the ali-frazier of the speech that i &apos;ve described , which is why i hope d ace it .
now , when i was a harvard officer in college , i had my first swim .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i thought something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in mature organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information on the cell is going to move on in both daughter .
but at the time , when <unk> organisms appeared , things started to change .
sexual reproduction enters the picture .
and most importantly , with the introduction of sexual reproduction that drive the genome , the rest of the body will blow itself away .
in fact , the notion of death of the death of our bodies is present in the same moment as sexual reproduction .
now , i have to say , if i was a <unk> , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death -- it seemed pretty sensible at the time , but with every year , it has come to my increased doubt .
i &apos;ve come to understand the emotions of george burns , who read his show in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s an pat on top of its wing .
it opens the door .
in front of him , it stands beautifully poorly .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the conclusion that i was a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not inevitably contradictory , just different .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i wanted to rebuild the health of a disease .
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about delivered the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survive generation after generation .
so from an evolutionary standpoint , you &apos;re and i developed like <unk> rockets to send the genetic wave into the next step of orbit to fall to the sea .
i think we would all think of the mood , the woody of all the expression , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get immortality through my work .
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
evolution does not necessarily mean the longest life .
it &apos;s not necessarily the biggest , the strongest or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution <unk> the creatures that adapt to their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there , and therefore they fall the hot steam , if there were fish there , would have eaten fish for them , but they &apos;ve managed to make a habitable environment there .
so , what does that mean , when we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the space of people in evolution , and , above all , how we look forward to the next phase , i would say there &apos;s a number of options .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of equilibrium .
and the reason for that would be that , by medicine , we &apos;ve been able to get a lot of genes that had otherwise been destroyed and had been removed from the population .
and secondly , we as a species have evolved our environment so that we have been able to adapt to us precisely as we adapt to them .
and by the way , we &apos;re going around and branching and blend so much that they can no longer say that isolation is necessary for evolution , in order to address .
a second possibility is that it will be a evolution of the traditional species , of course , imposed by the forces of nature .
and the argument , here , is that the wheels of evolution are slowly reused but they &apos;re collapsing .
and so , as far as isolation happens , if we colonize planets distant planets , it will be precaution and the changes of the environment that could produce evolution in the natural natural way .
but there &apos;s a third option , a tempting , intriguing and terrifying possibility .
i call it <unk> -- the new development that isn &apos;t just of course , but run , and decided to put ourselves into the decisions that we make .
well , how could this happen ?
how could we be that we could do this ?
let &apos;s first look at the reality that people today are making decisions about their offspring in certain cultures .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women are .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family choose .
so remember , if it &apos;s not only possible to choose the gender of your child but also to make the body genetic adaptations that would heal disease and prevent disease .
what if they could make the genetic changes to remove diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease , or to eliminate the decrease of the risk of risk or the ticket ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to make these changes in your genes ?
when we diverge , these kinds of changes are increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it was costing billion dollars .
the following year when it was done in 2004 , they could do the same for 20 million dollars in five months in five months .
today , you can take a sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome at a price of about 20,000 and in the space of about a week .
it will not be long , until the reality will be that it will be the 1,000 thousand human genomes , and it will be increasingly available for everyone .
one week ago , a week of engineering , the national academy of engineering for francis arnold and <unk> <unk> , two scientists that evolved independently from the techniques of evolution to work faster and to create more available proteins in a more efficient manner , which is called unnecessarily arnold &quot; direct evolution . &quot;
a few years ago , the teacher scientist of scientist was awarded his research for his research in which he took a grown-up , a <unk> , and using just four genes , the cell , to take it to a pluripotent stem cell -- a cell potentially is able to become any cell in your body .
these changes are in place .
the same technology that produces human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not just protection itself , but can also serve the immunity against other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in the gang with influenza that &apos;s been grown in the cell cell cells .
can you imagine a good thing coming out of tobacco ?
this is all reality today , and in the future , it &apos;s going to be much more possible .
now , imagine two other little changes .
you can change your cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your descendants ?
what if you could change the sperm and <unk> or the newly <unk> egg to give your children a better chance to live , eliminate the diabetes , remove the <unk> , reduce the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want to have healthier children ?
and then the analytical technique , the same motor of science that can allow the change to change disease , could allow us to help help adopt the disease , to help us to adopt the better memory .
why do not have the arc of a ken jennings <unk> , especially if you can extend it with the next generation of <unk> ?
why not have the fast <unk> that will allow them to run faster and longer ?
why no longer live ?
these are being irresistible .
and if we &apos;re at a point where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the characteristics that we want , we &apos;re going to be transformed from <unk> evolution to <unk> .
we &apos;re going to have a process that probably requires 100,000 years , and we can compress it to a thousand years , and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions with which their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , need to be around .
are we using these decisions to form a society which is better , which is more friendly ?
or will we be selectively choosing different attributes that we want to have for some of us and not for others ?
are we going to form a society that is more competitive and competitive , or more robust and dynamic ?
these are the kinds of questions we need to face .
and most importantly , will we ever be able to design the wisdom and the wisdom that we need to make these choices ?
good as in evil , and early as you might think , these decisions are about us .
thank you .
so i want you to imagine now , a portable robot that gives you <unk> skills , or another , that helps you get up and go back .
now at berkeley <unk> , we call these robots <unk> .
they &apos;re nothing other than something that they pop in the morning and gives them extra strength , and that will increase their velocity and help them maintain their balance .
that &apos;s actually the real nature of human and machine .
but not only that -- they fuse with the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers on average , with about 100 pounds on its back , and the demand is that they should carry more equipment .
now of course , this leads to some of the major complications -- <unk> , 30 percent of it -- chronic <unk> .
so we thought we would embrace this challenge and create a design system that would help with this problem .
so let me introduce you to <unk> -- or humanity &apos;s universal universal agent .
soldier : i can carry 200 pounds on rough terrain , for many hours .
so its flexible design enables you to live in places , crawl , and run highly agile movement .
it feels what i want to do where i want to go , and then increase my strength and resilience .
we &apos;re so far with presenting our <unk> to this device , this new exit technology in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
so let &apos;s take our look at skin users , something i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people who suggest the world in a wheelchair .
that &apos;s about one percent of all population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about very young people with spinal cord injury , who are in the heyday of their lives -- &apos; 20s , &apos; 30s , &apos; 40s -- and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about aging population , the numbers are multiplied .
and pretty much the only option -- when it comes to a charity , or other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so , by the way , for 500 years , since his , i have to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start writing a completely new chapter in mobility .
so let me introduce you now to think of amanda <unk> being carried by the spinal cord injury 19 years ago who had a result that she couldn &apos;t walk more than 19 years ago and so far .
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our breath .
it &apos;s got sensors .
his whole <unk> sensors in the crutches , the signals on the crutches , is vibrating on our back here .
you can also see <unk> , which is <unk> on their hips , just like they &apos;re moving forward in this very <unk> and very natural gait .
i was in the age of 24 , and when i was in northern afghanistan , when i was a <unk> <unk> , i was in <unk> .
in a fraction of a second , i lost each feeling and every movement underneath my host .
not long after that , a doctor goes into my hospital room and he said , &quot; amanda , you can never walk again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he puts any hope from my consciousness .
flexible technologies helped me learn , learn , ski , climb , and even driving with your hands .
but nothing was invented to let me go back , so far .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we &apos;ve got the potential to change life in the future of future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda here , for everyone here , for everyone .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m a boss of a non-profit organization called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t put up the poverty , i was struck as a commander of a program in a volunteer with a volunteer fire .
now , in our city where volunteers have supported a <unk> family , you have to be pretty early on the side of the road to be able to fly down .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer volunteer , so i had fairly good opportunities to go into it .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to reach the authorities and figure out what would be our jobs .
when i found the prison interview , he had just come into a very serious conversation with the <unk> , which surely had one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she stood in the jungle tank and the barefoot under a screen outside in the frozen rain while her house stood in flames .
the other woman volunteers who had arrived just before me -- let &apos;s call him mahatma luther -- who was the first one , was asked to go to the house and rescue the dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was so blown out of fear .
there was some lawyer , or <unk> , who could now tell for the rest of his life , that he was going to a nearby house to save a living thing , only because it was five seconds faster than me .
well , i was the next one .
the neon tie me up .
he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;ve got to go to the house .
you have to go up , in the fire , and you have to get a pair of shoes . &quot;
i swear it .
now , not exactly what i hoped i would have hoped to do , i went up -- walking up the stairs , down the hallway , in the real &apos; 70s , which , at that point , was already very finished in the place to get a pair of shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i carried my prey back down , where i met my cholesterol and my dear dog .
we put our treasures out into the field room , where , not surprisingly , got a lot more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the <unk> was given a letter to the <unk> in which they were going for the brave deployment in the rescue of their house .
one of the things that might valued kindness : somebody had put it even a few shoes .
both in my profession at robin alley as well as a volunteer firefighter , i witness of generosity and kindness at large scale , but i also see the case of altruism and unity of individuals .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look around in this room and see people that have either been a <unk> success or on their way there , i want to offer that memory : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait for making a difference in someone else &apos;s life until you &apos;ve reached your first million .
if you have to give something , give it away now .
use in a food soup , you put up a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day , we will have an opportunity to save someone &apos;s lives , but every day offers us the possibility to change one .
so put it off ; save your shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i just came back from a community that knows the secret of the human race .
a place where women are leading the <unk> , with sex says , and the game is determined -- where fun is serious .
and no , it &apos;s not rocket either or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their familiarity .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the forest of congo .
bonobos are brought together with chimps our closest living relative .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived about six million years ago .
well , chimps are known for their stomachs .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of data in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin
and while chimpanzees from big , <unk> , <unk> fellows led , the teaching of the elderly is females .
they really came up with this because this leads to a very <unk> society that has never been seen by deadly violence .
but unfortunately , bonobos are least familiar with the primates .
they live in the depths of the congo basin , and they &apos;re only hard to see the observation .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness itself -- the origin of violent debate that has been calling for decades and almost so many lives like world war ii .
it &apos;s not surprising that these destruction , too , are at risk of the bonobos .
<unk> and the decline of the gharial lead that you can &apos;t even fill a stadium with the remaining bonobos -- and even here we &apos;re not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a <unk> laugh that the trees fell down .
who are these related ?
we know it as &quot; love instead of war , &quot; because they have conflicting sex , with the functional partners , and the rules , the conflict and the social conflict .
i &apos;m not saying that would be the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because the bonobo &apos;s lives are made up of more than gaza .
bonobos -- like people , love playing their lives .
play is not just <unk> .
for us , and it &apos;s fundamental to the attachment of relationships and the care of tolerance .
we learn trust and the rules of play .
play enhances creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about production of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and when you watch bonobos in the game , you can see the evolutionary origins of human expression , dance and rituals .
play is the go-kart that we face .
now , i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you some unique images straight from the wild .
the first thing i do is i don &apos;t believe in football . i don &apos;t think of football .
so we &apos;re looking at a young female and males in a <unk> room .
look at what she is doing .
that could be the evolutionary origin of &quot; she takes it in the eggs . &quot;
except that i think it likes to be rather , not true .
yeah !
so <unk> are common , both in bonobos and in humans .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the amount of data that allows you to get new elements in the game -- like the testicles -- and also how the game deals with trust -- while it &apos;s doing tremendous fun simultaneously .
but the game is a wheel-leg game .
play is a design game , and it can take many of the shapes that some of them are kind of quiet about , <unk> , curious -- maybe to discover again .
and i want to show you , this is <unk> , a young female , and it playing peacefully with water .
i think just like you &apos;re playing alone , and we &apos;re looking at limitations of our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s this fake curiosity that lets us explore and interact , and the unexpected ones that we form are the real breeding breeding of creativity .
this is just a little glimpse of the vision that bonobos give us to our past and present .
but they true also a secret to our future , a future where we need to adapt to rising challenges through greater creativity and building cooperation .
and the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our main project .
to succeed in a multi-polar world , we have to play .
but are we going to best do the best thing we do ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and humans , life is not made of teeth and claws alone .
just if it doesn &apos;t seem appropriate , play is perhaps a <unk> game .
and therefore , my favorite group , let &apos;s embrace this gift of evolution and play together as we start to embrace creativity and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs , middle of 1979 , exactly the same day , at exactly the same moment , each owner of a baby -- okay .
so two pairs , each child , a baby .
now , i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time thinking about it , because if you think about the whole time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
just imagine that for a moment .
and in this scenario , imagine that in a case , the sperm is carrying a y net that meets the x chromosome of the egg .
and in the other case , the sperm is carrying x chromosome that meets x chromosome of the egg .
both of these are <unk> , both dancing .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
in most of my work , i have two hats .
in a hat , i &apos;m with the story of anatomy .
i &apos;m a historian , and in this case , i study how people thought about anatomy -- that means human body , animal bodies -- as they thought about in liquid fluids , with <unk> ; how they thought about bodies .
the other hat that i &apos;ve carried with my work is the campaigner , as a <unk> -- or , as i say sometimes , a impatient lawyer -- by people who are patients of doctors .
in this case , i &apos;ve worked with people who are asking students to question social norms .
so for example , i worked with people who are <unk> twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people who were working -- so people who were smaller than usual .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with extraordinary people whose gender is structured -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female <unk> .
and as a common term , we can use the word <unk> for it .
<unk> comes in many different forms .
i &apos;m just going to give you a few examples of the types of people who are not capable of male standards or female standards .
in one case , you may have someone with a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene of the y cable leaves the <unk> that we all have , in the stage , up to testicles .
and that &apos;s why the testicles in the <unk> stage add testosterone .
but because this individual are missing the receptors to detect the testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t react to testosterone .
and that &apos;s called agenda-setting .
so a lot of testosterone , but there &apos;s no reaction to that .
as a result , the body develops more of the typical female cases .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s trained as girls .
but it usually takes until they reach puberty and grow their breasts and develop , but they don &apos;t get their period until somebody comes to the fact that there &apos;s something different .
and they do some tests and they find that instead of <unk> and uterus , it &apos;s actually testicles , and it has a y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could hold this person for some male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something in our body that &apos;s called a <unk> .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
and the <unk> bubbles are made , which are <unk> hormones .
most women , as i do -- i think being a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know what my real math dog is , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like i actually talk to <unk> .
we produce <unk> , and we respond to <unk> .
and the implication is that someone like me actually has a brain that was exposed to more <unk> than a woman who has been born with testes and has a <unk> .
so gender is really complicated ; bees are not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some sense , they can spread across the entire bandwidth .
another example : a few years ago , i received the call of a 19 year-old man who was born as a boy , as a boy , he had a girlfriend , had sex with his girlfriend , lived as a man , and he had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus .
he had an extreme form of natural electronics .
it &apos;s got <unk> chromosome , and in the womb , its artillery were so highly active that it essentially produced a male <unk> .
and as a consequence , his <unk> male increased , his brain was exposed to the most respected male male .
and when he was born he looked like a boy -- nobody had anything .
and only when he got 19 , he got enough medical problems , actually , because the doctors found out that the doctors found out that he was in the inner female .
okay , so i &apos;m just a quick example of a kind of ectosymbiont .
some people with <unk> chromosomes , they develop something called a petition , which is a mean set of <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s <unk> or <unk> twins , it would often be adjusted to the norms , is not because it would be a lot of advantage for their physical health .
in many cases , these people are perfectly healthy .
the reason why you are doing many different kinds of surgical interventions is because they threaten our social categories .
our system is typically based upon the idea that a certain pharmaceutical expression comes with a particular identity .
so we have the concept that a woman is to be a female identity , to be a black person , is supposed to be supposed to have an african anatomy in terms of their own story .
so we &apos;ve got this terribly simplistic idea .
and when we &apos;re confronted with a body that is actually very different for us , it informs us in terms of these pathologies .
so in our culture , we have a lot of romantic ideas about homosexuality .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of pheromones .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is when children are born that two people are in a body , who are in a body .
where i &apos;ve been to see most of my excitement recently , south african african african artist was last year , whose gender was asked in the <unk> world cup in berlin .
a lot of journalists called me a question to the question , &quot; what are you going to do to tell us if <unk> <unk> is female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain to the journalists that they didn &apos;t have that test .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature , for us , is no line between male and female , or between male and <unk> and females and <unk> ; <unk> are us , which , of course , refer to them .
so we have this situation , where , as our science progresses , we need to recognize so much that those categories that we &apos;ve given for robust anatomic categories , which provide very simple production systems to create permanent nuclear causes , are much <unk> than we took .
and that &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
it &apos;s also in terms of race , which turns out to be much more complicated than we &apos;ve approved .
in our essays , we walked into all sorts of disciplines .
for example , we run to the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we going to do with the fact that we &apos;re only different from them from a few acres of fluids ?
as we move further and further forward , we will move into a zone of discomfort , where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that we have probably had is too simple .
we see it in all sorts of human lives .
one of the areas in which we look at this , in our culture , in today &apos;s culture , is the struggle of the beginning and the end of life .
we have a hard conversation about where a body becomes to people so that he has another right than fetal life .
we have very difficult conversations today -- perhaps not as public as in medicine -- about the question when someone is dead .
our ancestors had never had that hard to fight the question when someone was dead .
they just kept a feather under their nose , and when they moved , they haven &apos;t buried it .
if it stops moving , you &apos;d be buried .
but today we &apos;re in a situation where we take people to do critical organs and put them in person else .
and as a result , we get to struggle with the really difficult question , when someone is dead , and that puts us in a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have as simple categories as we did before .
now you might think the whole thing about a category of someone like me would really make me happy .
i &apos;m politically depressed , i encourage people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
to realize that those categories are much more insecure than we thought , make me tense .
and it makes me tense in terms of democracy in terms of democracy .
so to tell you about this session , i first have to hay , i &apos;m a big fan of dads .
i know they were adventurous , i know they were adventurous , but they were great .
i find that they were so brave and strong , and so radically , in what they were doing , that all of the years i &apos;ve been looking at this , i &apos;m going to look at the <unk> in 1776 every few years , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what crossed in 1776 is all over the place .
the founding fathers , i think , were the original <unk> activists , which is why .
what she was doing was a fixed concept , and they replaced it through another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you all remember , our founding fathers tore the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
the masters of the ancient world didn &apos;t have a concept based on dna , but they had a concept of concept .
they had a concept of some blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had the political power should have this political power because of the <unk> due to the son and so on .
and the founding fathers provoked this idea and replaced it through a new explosive concept , and this concept said that all human beings were created by the same .
they put the playing field and decided that anatomically , the common consequences , not the differences , and it was very radical .
now they did this because they were part of a system that had two things together .
democracy was growing , but at the same time , science was growing .
if you look at the story of founding fathers , a lot of them have been very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a multi-polar world .
they went away from obviously explanations , and meadows , like a supernatural concept of power , back where the transmission is based on a very vague review of birthright .
they moved into a pre-competitive concept .
and if you look at the declaration of independence , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and the nature of god .
you talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and then , as part of that , they gave us a concept that was environmentally common .
and they really , in a wonderful way , prepared the future movement movement .
they didn &apos;t think that much about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened years after ?
for example , women who used the right to vote on the right , the concept of founding fathers , says that , &quot; we have a uterus and encouragement more important than the anatomical judgments , and said , &quot; we have a uterus and ovaries as a difference to not that we should not have the right to have the right at full citizenship , etc . , etc . &quot;
and women delegate this successfully .
next was the successful civil rights civil rights , where we looked at people like <unk> <unk> , who complained about it , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> series of the <unk> , saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people who are different , more different skin points , who have been successful in anatomical outcomes .
we &apos;re seeing the same with the technology revolution .
of course , the problem is that , as we start to look at all the similarities , we need to start asking , why do we sustain certain divisions ?
now mind , i want to maintain certain divisions , physically , in our culture .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give a fish to the same rights as a human being .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take from anatomy altogether .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should have the right to have sex informed or to marry .
so there are some anatomic divisions that make sense to me and that we , i think , to keep .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep them , and if they make sense .
so , let &apos;s go back to these two things that are submitted to the beginning of the speech .
we have two creatures , both in the middle of 1979 , celebrated the same day .
so let &apos;s imagine that one of them , maria , three months ago , was born on the one june of 1980 .
heinrich , on the other hand , is born , and he was born on the one march in 1980 .
just because of the fact that maria was born for three months , she reached all kinds of three months before heinrich -- having the right to have sex , to choose the right to choose the right .
heinrich has to wait for all of this , not because he &apos;s got a different biological age just because of his birth .
we &apos;re finding other oddities on what their rights are .
heinrich , as you think he &apos;s male -- even though i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s a <unk> -- because you think he &apos;s male , he can now become moved , what maria doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
maria , whereas in all states , cannot perceive the same thing that henry has in all states , which is the right to marry .
heinrich can marry one woman in every state , but maria can only marry a woman today in a few states .
so we have these permanently sophisticated categories that are difficult and problematic in many ways .
and for me , the question is , what are we going to do , because our science is making progress like this in anatomy , that we get to a point where we have to admit a democracy based on anatomy ?
i don &apos;t want to give up the science , but at the same time it feels like science is on its own .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture is going to take a kind of pragmatic posture , &quot; okay , we need to get a line somewhere , so let &apos;s pull it somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people find themselves in a very strange position .
so for example , texas at one point decided that , in a man , texas means you don &apos;t have y chromosome , you have a woman to marry that you have a y chromosome .
now in practice , people will not test on their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of the story i told you about earlier the news project .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream , &quot; a kind of solution .
he says we shouldn &apos;t look for &quot; their skin color , but to judge their character , &quot; and go beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that ?
how do you evaluate people based on their traits ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be asking rights to people in humans , because i have to admit that i know a series of golden <unk> that probably deserve benefits more than some people i know .
i want to argue that i probably know some bright <unk> , who are <unk> , more intelligent and more sustained decisions to make their sexual relationships than some people i know .
so how are we going to ask the question of the character properties ?
and it turns out to be really difficult .
and part of me wonder , what if the content of a personality is something that would be made into the future -- could be made into an mri basis ?
do we really want to go this way ?
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going .
what i know is that it really seems important to think about the idea that the united states is leading to worry about the questions of democracy .
in our commitment to democracy , we have made our thing really well , and i think we &apos;d make our story good in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like , for example , in iran , where a man who is attracted to other men is having death , unless he is ready to participate in a charity , in which case he can stay alive .
these kinds of species exist with us .
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon that i spoke a few years ago , who had had a couple of senior twins who had had died to separate them , partly to make themselves a name .
but when i was working with him , and asked him why he made these surgeries -- it was highly stark surgeries -- his answer that in his country , these kids would be treated very badly , and therefore he had to do it .
i replied to him , &quot; now , have you taken a political asylum instead of taking a surgery to separate you ? &quot;
the united states provide incredible opportunities for allowing people to be who they are without changing the state of the state .
that &apos;s why i think we need to be leaders .
all right , just to close , i &apos;d like to see i talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibility of what democracy might look like , or looked looked something like , if we had the mothers more involved .
and i want to say something that is radical for a feminist feminist , and i think that there might be different kinds of insights that are surveyed by different kinds of anatomy , according to human beings , when people are applying a circuit company .
for years , since i was interested in <unk> , i &apos;ve also been interested in research in the field of research .
and one of the things that i found really interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and how to operate in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from <unk> studies is that women , on average -- not each , but on average -- is more likely to have complex social relationships and caring for people who are vulnerable to a lot of attention .
and that &apos;s why , if we think about that , we have an interesting situation .
years ago , when i made a graduate school , one of my graduate classes , who knew my interest in feminism -- i considered myself as a feminist , so do -- a really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what is female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the dumbest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about solving stereotypes about gender , so in feminism , nothing is female .
but the more i thought about his question , so much more i thought that there was something going on in feminism .
this is to say , well , there could be something on average , on average , whose female brains are different from male , what makes us vulnerable to the social social relationships , and more personally , to make sure that we are concerned .
so where the founding fathers were really focused on how individuals could be protected before the state , it &apos;s possible that if we put more mothers in this concept , we have more of a concept of not just how to protect , but how to care for each other .
and maybe it is that where we have to go in the future , when we &apos;ve driven democracy about anatomy -- less about the individual body in thinking about identity , and thinking more about relationships .
so that , as people trying to make a more free connection , we can think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a papercutter , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have in this , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with outfits .
i love to find an opportunity to find another <unk> , crazy outfit , and to photograph and blog recently .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes out of the second hand on <unk> and in <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allows me to reduce the impact of my <unk> on the environment , and also my purse .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars are usually serving a good cause ; i look pretty unique ; and it &apos;s making them shop for my very personal work .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
is it going to be my size ?
will i like the color ?
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers are yes , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase and tell you what i &apos;ve been messing up with here at ted for this exciting week .
i mean , what does anyone with so much outfits ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought with you .
i brought seven people &apos;s heels , and that &apos;s it .
underpants for just one week are all i did in my suitcase .
i &apos;ve bet i &apos;m going to make everything else i might want to wear , if i &apos;d just come to palm springs .
and since you &apos;ve not heard of me as the woman walking around at ted in her underwear -- that means i found a few things .
and i just want to show you my outfits for this week .
sounds like that ?
while i &apos;m doing that , i &apos;m also going to leave you with some of the lessons that i believe , believe it or not , from these <unk> , to wear nothing new .
let &apos;s start on sunday .
i call it the luminous tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look good .
you can always look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the coat , has taken me 55 cost , and it was the most expensive thing i carried in this whole week .
monday : color is a little powerful .
it &apos;s almost impossible impossible to be bad <unk> when you &apos;re wearing balloon pants .
if you &apos;re happy , then you draw other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation totally is totally overrated .
i have spent a lot of time in my life trying to be myself and adapt at the same time .
be just like who you are .
if they are surrounded with the right people , they &apos;re not just going to understand it , they &apos;ll appreciate it .
wednesday : take her inner child .
sometimes people say to me , i saw as if i play &apos; wear or that i remember them .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : self-confidence is the key .
if you think you look in something good , it &apos;s almost certainly that way .
and if you think you &apos;re not looking good into something , you &apos;re probably right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only when i got 30 i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;ll wrap it up for a second .
if you believe that you are inside and below a great person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for anyone here in this audience .
we should be able to rock everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words for everything .
and finally , saturday : to develop one , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word .
it got me over and over again when this week people came up to me just because of what i was wearing . and i had great conversations .
obviously it &apos;s not going to fit into my little suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i will donate all this to you .
because the lesson that i try to learn this week is because it &apos;s okay to go .
i don &apos;t have to get emotionally rid of this stuff , because right around the corner , there &apos;s always a different kind of crazy object that &apos;s going to be waiting for me when i have some love in the heart and searching it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , all together .
i have something here to show you .
think of this as a libertarian , as flying <unk> .
this is what we call , design design in our lab .
so let me tell you a little bit about this .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m actually italian , and anyone in italy is growing in a room with this picture in his room , but the reason i show you this is that in the formula one over the last decade , something interesting happened .
a while ago , if you wanted to win a formula , they took their budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
now these days , if you want to win a race , actually , something like this -- something that the car touches in real time , a number of thousands of sensors that can share information from the car , that information to the system and then process it and then use those to make things back and change things in real time as information is collected .
you would call this in <unk> , which is a design factory .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made out of two parts -- a <unk> portion , and a solar system .
what &apos;s interesting today is this phenomenon is starting to show up in our lives .
our cities have been equipped in the last few years with networks and electronics .
they become computer in the free computer .
and as a computer in the free , you start reacting in other ways , you recognize and driven .
when we zoom in cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal .
just by the way , i &apos;d like to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population is living there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the gdp -- add up to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something about the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
beyond cities , all of this sense of view and push into objects of everyday life .
this is from an exhibition , the paola antonelli for moma later in the year , during the summer .
it &apos;s called &quot; the talk to me . &quot;
well , all our objects , our environment , start to speak to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like any atom out there becomes either , a sensor and a timer .
and it changes radically the interaction we humans have on our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , when a governor shaped the moses , it means that he took the hammer at the end , and he threw it on moses -- actually , you can still see a little spot on moses -- and said , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> ? why don &apos;t you mention ? &quot;
now , the first time our environment begins to answer us .
i &apos;m just going to show you a few examples -- again , this idea of perceiving and driving our environment .
let &apos;s start with the perception .
so the first project i want to show you is actually one of the first of our labs .
it originated and a hundred and a half years ago .
and what we did was , in fact , use a new kind of network that was used all over the world -- this is an aerial system -- and using the blind information from this network that could actually be collected from the operators to understand how the city works .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was as a italy that was in italy .
some of you may remember it was a italy in italy , and then at the end of the day , the <unk> .
and no matter , in italy , won at the end .
now , look at what happened that day , just watching the activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you can see in the middle , the colosseum , the river <unk> .
in the morning , before the game .
you can see the timeline up there .
afternoon , people here , and there , they make calls and move .
the game starts -- silence .
france makes a door . italy makes a gateway .
and through , people make a short call , they go to the bathroom .
second sabbatical . the end of the normal hand .
first extension , second .
<unk> , in a moment of conducting .
italy wins . yeah .
well , during that night , everybody went to celebrate the center .
they saw the big matters .
the next day , everyone in the center went to the center and meeting the prime minister at the same time .
and then everybody went down .
you see the picture of the place , <unk> intimacy , where , since the roman period , people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the key effect at the end of the day .
now , this is just one example of how we can feel the city today in a way that we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
very quickly , another example of feels : this isn &apos;t about people , it &apos;s about things that we use and consume .
well , now we know where our things are coming from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips from which a mac computer came from , how they came together .
but we know very little where things go .
so in this project we actually designed some little markers to track the garbage as it passes through the system .
so we started with a bunch of volunteers that were helped us , a little over a year ago in seattle , helped tag the things that they made -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that you would throw out anyway .
we then put the little chips , the little brands , put it on the garbage and start tracking it .
so here are the results we just got .
from seattle ...
after a week .
with that information , we realized there &apos;s a lot of knowledge in the system .
we can do the same things with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s going to happen a lot of <unk> , complicated things .
the other thing is , we believe that if we see every day that the cup that we throw out , that the cup that we throw away , it &apos;s not just disappearing that it &apos;s still on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we throw away every day is still there .
and if we were to show that to people , then we can drive change change .
so this is the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , <unk> <unk> , could tell you a lot more about that , and the many other wonderful things that you can make sense of , but i want to talk to the second part that we discussed in the beginning , and that &apos;s the most basic part of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in <unk> , spain .
and it started with a question of the senior age who came to us and said that spain and engineering have a beautiful tradition to use water as part of architecture .
and the question was : how could you bring technology , new technology with it ?
and one of the ideas that have been shown at the heart of a game is , imagine these tubes , and valves , <unk> , things that open and close .
it will cause you to do something like a woodpecker made out of water .
if you fall down , you can write these patterns , images , text , text .
and you can approach it , and it &apos;s going to open you to make it happen , as you can see in this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor of <unk> .
he really enjoyed it .
and we got to design a building to design the expo .
we called it the digital water .
the whole building was made out of water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you approach it , it will open and you put it in .
the roof was covered with water as well .
and if you &apos;re going to reduce the syringes , you can actually get the roof down .
or you could end the building , and the whole architecture , as in this case , you know , those days when you pull the roof , you get pictures of people who were there saying , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t break the building , it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappears .
here &apos;s how the building works .
you can see the person wondering what &apos;s going on inside .
and here you see me trying to test the sensors that opened the water , not getting wet .
now , i should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped .
but actually it was a bit more fun that night .
all the children from <unk> came to the building , because the way they played the building was quite different .
no longer a building that would open you , but a building that still has breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump right now without getting wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we &apos;re always thinking about how people use the things that we design .
but reality is always unpredictable .
and this is the beauty of creating things that are used and interacting with people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , the residue of water and the projection on it .
and this is what led us to thinking about the following project , which i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine those lionesses could actually begin to fly .
imagine if you could have little chairs flying through the air , and each of them with a little tripod of light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the room .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter like the one you saw earlier , which is moving in contact with other people .
you can have the cloud .
you can have a kind of a flexible display or display , like this -- a gradual formation in two dimensions .
or infrequently , in three dimensions , which is what &apos;s changing , the light is not the position of <unk> .
they can play with different species .
imagine the screen just in different formats , or height , in different proportions .
but then the whole thing could be just a 3d cloud made for you to walk and through which you can move through , which you can look at many , many directions .
and what you &apos;re looking at here is a real coral map , the <unk> , to form a <unk> v .
when you turn the lights on , it looks like this . so , the way we saw it before .
so imagine that every single person is being run by people .
it could have a impulse that could come from human , from people &apos;s movements or so forth .
let me show you a little bit first here .
we &apos;ve been working with <unk> <unk> , one of the best ballet dancers of our time -- the prison ballet theater at the metropolitan theater in new york , and the scala in milan -- we &apos;ve taken its movements in 3d to use it as a momentum for the world bank .
this is dancing dancing .
on the left you see the <unk> , the different <unk> sensations .
it &apos;s at the same time a <unk> and a carbon-60 .
so they can understand the whole movement .
you can do this all the time .
but then , once you have all the bacteria , you can play with it and play with color and gravity and play .
that &apos;s what we want to do as a possible impulse for the overall grid .
and i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something we work on for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
and the idea is that , again , imagine what we &apos;re doing again to engage people in and to change the environment -- almost something like what we call it , <unk> , how to do it , but with a cloud .
so , imagine everybody can give a donation on a small donation .
and i think the remarkable thing about what happened last year is that we have changed from a physical world to a digital world .
this has digitized everything , knowledge and making it accessible by the internet .
now , for the first time -- and the campaign obama has shown this -- we can get from the digital world , of the most dangerous forces of the networks to the physical world .
this can be , in our case , that we use it to design and to create a symbol .
that &apos;s something that &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , to bring us to the challenges -- think about the climate change , or the co2 emissions -- how can we move from the digital world to the physical world .
so the idea is that we actually engage the people in which they together , collectively , do things together .
the cloud again is a cloud cloud , in the same way that a real cloud is a cloud made out of particles .
and these particles are water , as our cloud is from a cloud cloud .
it &apos;s an adaptive piece in london , but it &apos;s covered with bugs .
they can move in and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at them from the bottom , which are the most important moments for <unk> 2012 and beyond , and use it as a kind of connection to community .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something at the top that you can go to , like london &apos;s new mountain .
they can go in .
and a kind of digital lighthouse at night -- but as a computer , a new kind of experience for all who want to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , the connection is really important to me .
through my work , i &apos;m trying to express that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is connected .
for the first time , i was in antarctica almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first icebergs .
i stepped out awe .
my heart jumps , i was <unk> , while i was trying to grab what was in front of me .
the reverberation around me would cover almost 60 feet from the water , and i could just wonder that this was a snowflake on another snowflake year after year .
icebergs are born as calf of a glacier or by breaking out <unk> .
each iceberg has its own individual personality .
they interact in a clear way with their environment and their experiences .
some people are refusing to give up and <unk> until the bitter end , while others don &apos;t reach it anymore and , you know , more sophisticated passion .
when you look at a chunk , it &apos;s easy to be isolated , apart and just , as we often see humans .
but the truth is far away .
as a iceberg melts , i came up with its dry atmosphere .
as the iceberg melts , he releases <unk> drinking water that feeds many life forms .
i go to my footage of these icebergs as if i &apos;m making portraits of my ancestors , in the awareness that they exist in those individual moments , and they never exist again .
it &apos;s not a death of death , when it &apos;s melting ; it &apos;s not the end , it &apos;s a micrograph of your <unk> running along the life cycle .
part of the ice in the northern sea i &apos;m most young -- a few thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you , i &apos;ll show you , is a chunk that i put in <unk> in greenland .
very rarely you are actually witnessing a <unk> iceberg .
so here it is .
on the left you see a little boat .
that &apos;s about five meters long .
i want you to look at the shape of the iceberg and where it &apos;s in the space form .
you can see here he starts rolling , and the boat has moved to the other side , the guy stands there .
that &apos;s the average size of a spectrogram .
he stood about 120 feet of water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and so , just showing the iceberg a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is truly blessed by work on some amazing projects .
but for the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked on , it was this guy .
his name is zumra .
<unk> was one of the leading ceos in the 1980s .
then one day , he came back and he said , &quot; dad , my legs were running away . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the outbreak .
<unk> is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i stood across him .
i have a company that makes design and animations , so graffiti has inevitably a complex part of what we admire and look at in the art world .
so we decided , tony -- <unk> -- and his thing to support .
and i met with his father and his brother , and i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i &apos;ll only want to talk to tony again .
i just want to go back and say , &quot; wait a minute , is this not -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t communicate all the paralyzed people using these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you &apos;ve heard about the higher <unk> and have a remarkable insurance , you can actually do that .
normal people are not accessible to these devices . &quot;
and i was like , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
did anybody see the film &quot; butterfly and <unk> &quot; ?
this is how you communicate -- you walk along your fingers .
i was astonished , &quot; well , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with a need for just a check , and instead i put a check that i didn &apos;t have the foggiest idea of how to cash it .
i committed to the place and i go to his brother and his father -- saying , &quot; well , my proposal is like , &quot; well , my proposal is this : tony &apos;s speaking , we &apos;ll get him a device , and we &apos;ll find a way that he can make his artwork again .
because it is a farce that someone who &apos;s still carrying it can &apos;t communicate . &quot;
so a few months later , i spoke at a conference .
i met these people from <unk> , brilliant research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface , and then draw a laser laser tag that has only the negative area .
so they go around and they make toys like this .
they say all things that are displayed up there follow a life cycle .
it starts with the orientation , then the <unk> , then the <unk> , and finally , people get art .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
so i went home to dinner with my wife and told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , wait a second , if there &apos;s this technology that allows you to use your eyes to control things , we should find a way to control a laser that can drive a laser so that it can make you graffiti again , that would be awesome . &quot;
that was the start of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , about a lot of organization and a lot of things , we &apos;ve done a few things .
first of all , we got the insurance company on the doors , and actually got a device for computer models to communicate with it -- an stephen <unk> .
that was incredible .
and it &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him <unk> , because you talk to him , or you get email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so embarrassed , this guy is incredible . &quot;
also , we have seven programmers from all over the world -- literally out of all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my kids and i have moved to the garage , and i &apos;ve taken those hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> , who have taken our house .
a lot of our friends thought we were pretty stupid to do that , and that we would live , and all the images on the walls would be <unk> .
but for over two weeks , we &apos;ve programmed , we went to the national institute in venice , my kids were involved , including my dog , and we created this .
it &apos;s called agenda-setting , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap heat band that we bought at the brink of venice , a little bit more atonal , and a few things from the hardware store and the cable pool .
we took a map of cards , they put it on a light , and now we have a device that &apos;s freely available -- you can build it yourself ; we put the code free , the software can download free .
so we created a device that is completely devoid of limitations .
no insurance can .
there &apos;s no hospital .
now , each paralyzed can actually communicate or draw with your eyes .
thank you .
thank you so much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back in <unk> room .
i love this picture because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and that &apos;s his room .
now there &apos;s all this new revelation in front of the great unveiling .
and over a year of planning , two weeks , <unk> , <unk> nights , tony drew for the first time after seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he looks at his life support system .
we have tended down his bed so that he can see .
we put a projector set up against a wall of the team at the hospital .
and he drew again for the first time , in the <unk> of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a sense that was in the parking lot .
but for some reason , we had to break into the parking lot , so we felt as comfortable as part of the sustainability lot .
in the end , he sent us an email saying , &quot; for the first time , i &apos;ve drew something .
i &apos;ve got the feeling i kept under water , and i finally picked up my head and raised my head so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
that &apos;s the kind of thing that we do .
that keeps us in the flight and keeps us growing .
and we need to improve a lot on this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a transformative device .
and someone who has such artistic potential deserves so much more .
so we &apos;re in figuring out how to do it better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we have received all kinds of recognition .
we won some prizes .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserve it .
it all comes from our own pockets .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> over us and then , in december , the greatest student honored us as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
and the coolest thing about it is -- and that includes the whole circle -- that this april , when in the middle of los angeles , there will be an exhibition called &quot; kind of the streets . &quot;
and there &apos;s probably a lot of the toughest representatives of the telecommunications present present , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys will be there .
<unk> will be part of the show , which is pretty wild .
so basically , what i &apos;m going to do is , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , it can happen .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the <unk> -- everything was impossible at some point .
make it possible -- all of you here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i &apos;ve never had anything to do with anything , but i just captured a little bit and surrounded myself with amazing people so that we could put something on the ground together .
and that question should each of you , and it &apos;s every single day that you feel that you have to do something that &apos;s going to have to work , if not now , then , when ? and not me , who ?
thank you .
so , i write for children , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most commonly <unk> .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to come in like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or leather , but no one ever elected farmers .
today i want to tell you about circles and revelations .
well , an epiphany is usually something that you find , because you dropped it somewhere .
you go around the block and you take it as a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends made it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you about today .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s at high school in <unk> , ohio , where i was the <unk> .
i was the one who was beaten in green and blue every week , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by using the toilet in the <unk> .
they did it secretly .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go out of town .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it turned me down to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then in the &apos; 80s , i found it important to record a work at <unk> .
about three or four years ago , i got out in the middle of the night a call from this teacher , woman post , who said , &quot; i have to see it .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never known each other as adults .
can you come to ohio , and please come with the guy i know that you &apos;ve found now .
and i should mention that i &apos;ve worked out , and i want you to be quick . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we laughed , and we knew that she had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we took them , and we took care of them , and we got eight of them for their family , because it was necessary .
it was something that we knew we knew .
and just as a woman who was trying to learn me as adults , she turned to me , she turned it into a box of ash and was placed in my hands .
what happened was that the circle had closed , it had become a circle -- and the revelation that i talked about was going on .
the revelation is , death is a part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i save her life .
and you know , this part of life needs everything the rest of life needs .
it needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this has been mentioned so many times .
he needs the same -- he needed , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s on us to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion coming up on 1,000 feet .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a plant plant , which is 21 , feisty , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , <unk> .
that sounds daunting .
well , i had a unique place on that day ; i was sitting on <unk> .
i was the only one who could speak with the aids community .
so i looked at them the same , and they said , &quot; no problem , we probably have caught a few birds . &quot;
the pilot had already the coins , and we weren &apos;t that far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later happened three things at the same time .
the pilot runs the machine after the hudson river .
that &apos;s not usually the route .
it switches down the engines .
imagine an average airplane in front of you .
and then he said three words -- the most stupid words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; observations for the contract . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the snoring anymore .
i was able to see it in your eyes , there was a horror life .
i want to share with you three things i &apos;ve learned that day about me .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
we have this <unk> , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to make a hand , and i didn &apos;t do it , all the fences that i wanted to try to fix , all the experiences i wanted to do and never did .
as i was thinking about that later , a phrase occurred to me , &quot; i collect bad wines . &quot;
because if the wine is so far and the person is there , i open it .
i never want to make a difference directly in life .
and that urgency , that goal , really changed my life .
the second thing that i learned that day -- and that was when we met the george washington bridge , pretty much about 1911 -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing that i really want to have regret .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity and with my flaws , i suggested to be better about what i was going to do .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve also given my ego room .
and i shake the time that i wasted for <unk> things with people who mean something .
and i was thinking about the relationship with my wife , friends .
and after that , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t have argued for two years with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to be right ; i have taught myself to be happy .
the third thing that i learned -- and while the internal clock shop , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ... &quot;
you can see the water coming .
i said , &quot; please fly the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to fit into 20 parts , like you know of a documentary .
as we smoked , i had this feeling of being a man who is not terrifying .
it &apos;s almost like we &apos;re preparing our lives for it .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sadness really , really in one thought , was that i just wishes one thing .
i just wish i &apos;d see my kids grow up .
about a month after that , i went to visit my daughter &apos;s opinion -- first , not a lot of artistic talent .
... not yet .
and i confess , i swear like a little kid .
and in the world , everything was making sense for me .
i was very clear at the time by connecting the dots that life is about being a great parent .
more than anything , anything else , my only goal is in life to be a good father .
i was told the miracle of not dying that day .
i got another gift , which is to see the future and come back and live in other ways .
my call to all of you who fly today is , imagine what happens on your flight -- please not -- but do you think about it , and how would you change ?
what would they do because they think they &apos;re going to be there forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything , are they the best parents that they can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the stuxnet zx80 is pretty straightforward .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post there for the advancement of nuclear weapons is the default unit of nuclear nuclear weapons .
the gray boxes , which you see here , these are rejects .
now if we can have the systems that control the systems and the valves , then we can actually do a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can do it that an effective crocodile on a laptop is used on a fire scanner , it &apos;s in the business .
and this is the planning behind stuxnet .
so we start with a process of water .
the <unk> go round into the gray box , damage the centrifuge and iranian amazon -- mission .
that &apos;s a piece of cake , right ?
let me tell you how we found it .
so when we began to daydream our research six months ago , it was completely unknown what the meaning and purpose of that play was .
the only thing that we knew is very , very complicated , in terms of the most fundamental part , the most serious part , he made low-cost <unk> any soft use .
and it seemed to be a little bit phallic , with these gray boxes , these furry <unk> boxes .
this attracted our attention , and we started a worldwide project where we were infected our environment with stuxnet , studying this construct .
and then something funny happened .
stuxnet was worried of what our cheese didn &apos;t like -- <unk> , but didn &apos;t want to eat him .
and that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and after experimenting with various kinds of cheese , it occurred to me that this was a targeted attack .
totally targeted to a certain target .
the <unk> <unk> is running around in the gray box when a special configuration was discovered , and even when the special program is trying to infect it on this goal .
and if , if not , libby does not do anything .
so that really got my interest , and we started working with it , almost around the watch , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could be , for example , a u.s. american power station , or a disaster company in germany .
so better soon we should find out what the goal is .
so we wake up the dna code and we found that it &apos;s in two digital warheads -- a smaller and a bigger one .
and we also realized that they were designed very professional , by people who had obviously had all the processed information available .
they knew all the bits that they needed to attack .
in fact , they &apos;d even known the ranks of the shah .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve already noticed that the main wall of romo is complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the main news theory is a science for itself .
it &apos;s far more difficult than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
this is a clip from this <unk> code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
looks a little bit like old-fashioned <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart in this code .
so what we were first looking for was decision-making views because we know what they &apos;re doing .
and then we went to senators and <unk> and tried to engage them with the real world -- potential targets in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could prove or disprove .
in order to make these theories , we call ourselves that it &apos;s definitely <unk> , it has to be a high school goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran , because most of the infections have been reported there .
now , there aren &apos;t several thousand goals in this area .
and basically , it &apos;s going down to the <unk> plant and it &apos;s on <unk> in <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; bring me a list of all sorts of experts and power plants from our client . &quot;
and i called them up and they gave her knowledge to compare their expertise to what we &apos;ve found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , we were able to connect the little digital <unk> with the <unk> .
and the rotor of rotor is this moving part within the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
and when you tamper in the speed of this , you can actually crack the rotor of rotor and even , finally , to explode the centrifuge .
what we also found out is that the target of the attack was actually slow and engaging -- obviously trying to <unk> , so that they would not be able to get there quickly .
the great digital megalomaniacs -- we got insight in by looking at very precisely data and <unk> .
so for example , the number of <unk> yellow is very different from this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
i started using scientific literature about how they were built in <unk> , and they found that they &apos;re a fitting in what &apos;s called the <unk> , and each rung of it contains <unk> <unk> .
so that made sense , it fit together .
and it got better .
these clipboards in iran are divided up at 15 so-called levels .
and guess what we found in the educational sector ?
it &apos;s an almost identical structure .
so again , that fit really well .
and that gave us great confidence for what we studied here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , it didn &apos;t just work that way .
these results have been done hard work through several weeks .
and often we just ran in a dead end and we had to rebuild ourselves .
anyway , we found that both digital warheads are actually pointing into one and the same target , but from different directions .
this little <unk> takes over a roller , and picks out the rotors and cuts it down , and the great layer of paper starts with six degrees of interactions and manipulated the valves .
so , in general , we &apos;re very hopeful that we actually must have what the goal is .
it &apos;s insidious , and it &apos;s just symbolism .
so we have to worry that other things could be hit by stuxnet .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- really blown me out of socks .
the gray box down there is the gray box , and the gray box on top of it .
now , what this thing is doing is that it transfers the resources of sensors -- so , for example , <unk> and <unk> -- and it provides legitimized code that is still under the attack , with the wrong amount of data .
and in fact , that fake <unk> data is actually recorded before .
so it &apos;s just like <unk> , where during the car crash , the <unk> was fed with previously <unk> video .
it &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
and the idea here is obviously not just the control control in the control system .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more aggressive .
so the idea is to cheat a digital settlement .
we need digital <unk> there , where a human settlement cannot respond fast enough .
so in a power station , if the big wave of energy is getting too quick , you have to go and open in just milliseconds .
of course , this cannot be done by a human being .
so at this point , we need digital information exploration .
and if you &apos;re at risk , really bad things can happen .
the power plant can explode .
and neither the <unk> , the <unk> will notice it .
this is frightening .
but it gets worse .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . this attack is <unk> .
it &apos;s nothing special to do with <unk> , with <unk> .
so he would work for example exactly as well -- in a power station or in a factory factory .
it &apos;s non-orientable .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to have the basic stick on a stick stick , as we saw in stuxnet .
you could also use ordinary wireless technology to start spreading .
you just have to disseminate it as far as you can .
and eventually , if you do that , you get a <unk> weapon of mass destruction .
that &apos;s the consequence we have to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals for this attack is not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the most non-specific environments .
we need to make the consequences , and we better get ready to prepare .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , there &apos;s been a lot of it reported that people assume that the <unk> is the most profitable .
is that your mind ?
okay , you really want to know ?
yeah . okay .
in my opinion , the default driver is involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving power behind that is the most reliable superpower .
there &apos;s only one and those are the united states -- fortunately , for happiness .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for sharing us . thank you .
i &apos;ve spent the last couple of years trying to place in situations which normally are very difficult and at the same time .
i went to prison -- hard .
i worked in a field of care -- dangerous .
i was shot in the war war -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days trying to eat nothing like this -- fun at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous .
in fact , i &apos;ve been exposed to most of my career &apos;s career looking at awful situations , and this is all for trying to look at social sciences that are compelling and interesting , and hopefully in a way that makes it fun and accessible to the audience .
so when i knew that i was going to come here in a tedtalk to look at the world of <unk> and <unk> , i knew i &apos;d do something else .
some of you may have heard that a few weeks ago , i ran an ad on ebay .
i sent out a couple of comments , some tweets , and i gave people the opportunity to <unk> my tedtalk in 2011 .
really , a few happy people and companies , lawyers and <unk> , got an opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let it go -- to buy the <unk> at the talk that you just see , who didn &apos;t have a title , didn &apos;t have a lot of content , and didn &apos;t have a lot of evidence of what the subject was .
so what you got was this : your name here : my tedtalk , of which you have no idea what the subject is going to be , and that , after all , you might be able to fly around your ears for the ears , especially if i let your company look dumb for your participation .
but besides it , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
do you know how many people watch those tedtalks ?
a lot .
by the way , this is just the sonogram .
so despite that warning , i knew anybody was going to buy the <unk> .
now if you asked me this one year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you this with certainty .
but in the new project that i work on , my new film , we explore the world of marketing , the ad .
as i said before , i went through some pretty terrible situations over the years , but nothing helped me to go out and get something out of something as dangerous and dangerous as to go to a room with these guys .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
what i &apos;d like to do is make a film about <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the film is going to be called &quot; the <unk> <unk> gyrus . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the <unk> <unk> interface &quot; is that everything , from the top up to the end , from the beginning up to the end , is complete with brands -- from the <unk> you &apos;ll see in the movie , that &apos;s brand x .
so this brand , the <unk> stadium , the <unk> center ...
these people will be connected to the film in eternity forever .
and so the movie will examine this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity , forever ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
that was more for accent .
it was &quot; in eternity , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not only going to have the brand x brand , but we &apos;re going to make sure we &apos;re going to sell any category at the film .
this is how we might sell a shoe , and it will be the greatest shoe that you &apos;ve ever worn ...
the greatest car you &apos;re ever going to have , from &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; is the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , an awareness of &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is to show that brands are part of life , in fact , to get them to finance the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole movie is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie of dongguan .
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i &apos;d love to be able to make sure that this was going to help us .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how resourceful people will be .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; angle &quot; because it has an negatives -- but do you know how this is going to evolve ?
how much money is needed to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet you , but i think it &apos;s worth a matter of some really familiar brands .
who knows when the movie comes out , we might look like a hair of hair coming out .
what do you think the answer will be like ?
the answer will be most likely &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a hard thing to do because of the film or a hard thing for me ?
jk : both .
... meaning , meaning , not so optimistic .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands .
yeah .
if you look at the people you have to do with it ...
there are some places that we can turn to .
so imagine the camera .
and i thought , &quot; well , imagine what the camera was like , &quot; would mean we wanted to have an online system .
it turns out it actually meant , &quot; we want nothing to do with your movie . &quot;
and that &apos;s how all these companies disappeared one after another .
i didn &apos;t want to have something to do with the movie .
i was amazed .
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with the project .
and i was confused because i thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising , was to present your product as many people as possible , as many people as you can see .
especially in the world today , on this intersection of new and old media and the most competitive media media , it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting argument , that the crowds will bring that message .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea was a fatal mistake , and that was the following .
actually , that wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
that would have been fine .
but what this picture says is a problem .
see , if you put transparency in the first term , this is -- this is one of the first images that appears .
i really like your kind , sergey brin . now .
that was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and <unk> , simply to discover and understand , just characterizes of visibility and access to information , especially in terms of climate change -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we hear a lot right now about transparency .
our politicians tell us that our president says it even tells our ceos .
but when it comes to the top that it &apos;s supposed to be implemented , something is changed .
but why ? well , transparency is made -- like this strange bear , still screams .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like this weird highway .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is risk ?
it &apos;s a whole bowl of cool <unk> food .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid and my father caught me lying -- and there he is , and looking at me with that view -- would he say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions in each story .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so , you see , with the film , we wanted to tell the real version .
but there &apos;s only one company , an agency who was willing to help us -- and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve known john bond and richard <unk> for years -- i realized i needed to do it alone , i had to go to the middle man and go straight with my team .
so what they started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that , when you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand understood , is a profound problem .
i &apos;ve got friends , the big , giant <unk> , and i have friends who have little <unk> like me .
and my friends , the big , giant <unk> , will say that the reason their films are so successful , is to the most prolific ones they have .
and then my friends , who are making little <unk> , &quot; well , how are we going to compete with these big , gigantic economies ? &quot;
and the movie is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so , how exactly are you going to see for a ban in this movie ?
every time i get on the way , and whenever i open up the <unk> , you &apos;ll see for 1,600 soldiers .
and every time i put somebody together , i can say , &quot; are you scratch for this interview ?
are they there ? they look a little nervous .
i want to help you calm down .
so maybe before the interview , you should be a little bit better about this . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great metrics .
either &quot; <unk> fusion &quot; or &quot; paradise <unk> , &quot; you &apos;ll have choices .
we &apos;re going to be equipped for men and women -- solid , <unk> , stick , stick , whatever .
this is the pudong .
now , i can answer all of your questions and give you a more reliable perspective .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we are an economic vehicle .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so doing these kinds of things -- you know , people in ban ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
what words would you describe for a ban ?
you know , ban is <unk> .
that &apos;s a great question .
this is <unk> technology .
technology is not the way that you should describe something that someone goes into .
so this is audacious , fresh .
i think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category really makes you feel too positive , as opposed to &quot; fighting odor and humidity . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them fresh longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three fresh buildings .
these things have a transformative effect .
and this is a picornavirus .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
i have to talk to the guy on the street who are like me , <unk> .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you be able to describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like beautiful clothes .
it &apos;s &apos; 80s meets <unk> , except at the end of the office .
all right , what &apos;s your brand tilting ?
unique .
i think the <unk> , the style that i have is probably &quot; dark glamour . &quot;
i like lots of black colors , lots of <unk> , and stuff like that .
but usually i have a <unk> , like sunglasses , or a jewelry , and stuff like that .
if dan was a brand , he would probably be a classic mercedes .
i would say it &apos;s a man 2 : the brand i am , i would say , fly away .
woman 2 : partly hippie , partly yogi , partly <unk> -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the instructor man .
i sell <unk> across the country , worldwide .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
that &apos;s my brand in my little , distorted industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex because i was adventurous .
man 5 : brand <unk> <unk> .
is it going ?
attorney : i &apos;m a papercutter .
i am tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be <unk> , but i often look at the interfaces of dark glamour and jazz fly .
and what i realized was that i needed an expert .
i needed someone to go down into my head , someone who really could help me understand what to call the &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so i came up with a company called olson <unk> .
they have helped firms like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , to discover these kinds of skills .
if you could do it for those , you could also help me .
you brought her pictures , right ?
that &apos;s what i did . the first painting is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how this is connected to your thoughts and feelings about yourself .
these are the people who shape my worldview .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the world is the world that you live in -- like people around you , the friends , the family , the way you live your lives , work and stuff .
all of these things come from and start from a place to me , and start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what leads to the thoughts and feelings of yourself ?
it &apos;s the way i &apos;d like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like strange things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; -- what does it bring you ?
what &apos;s the capsule ? what on earth are they at the moment ?
why is it important ? what does the red represents ?
tell me a little bit about that part .
a little bit more about you that you &apos;re not .
what else do they have actually go through ?
i don &apos;t need to be afraid . what kind of rollercoaster do you have ?
<unk> ! no , thank you .
thank you for your patience .
yeah . all right .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to make up .
there was a lot of crazy things going on there .
the first thing that i saw was that the idea of having two separate cells two separate , but turned out to be similar pages -- the morgan wilkes is a <unk> / 100th brand .
it &apos;s a very good one .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with that .
and i think some companies will just focus on one strength , rather than both .
many companies tend to -- and that &apos;s human nature -- to avoid things that you &apos;re not sure you &apos;re going to be afraid of , you &apos;re going to avoid fear , these elements , and you &apos;re going to turn them , and you &apos;re turning it into something for yourself , and that &apos;s a permanent move .
what other brands do they do ?
the first one is a classic , apple .
and you can see here , <unk> , wii , mini of mini <unk> and <unk> .
now , there are <unk> brands and <unk> brands , these things that come and go , but a final brand brand brand is a pretty powerful thing .
an engine , brand brand . how is your brand ?
if somebody asked you to describe your <unk> , your mood , how about you ?
you &apos;re looking at it , is it something that you get your blood into <unk> ?
or are they more like a viewing bird ?
is it something that is slightly slower , more livable , more conservative ?
<unk> are things that are playful , fresh like the <unk> prince , <unk> , <unk> , dropped and glorious like <unk> , agile and urbanism , profane , <unk> , magical and <unk> like <unk> .
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are they mindful and ruthless like <unk> ?
are they established , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , compassionate like oprah ?
are they reliable , stable , motivational , safe , poised , <unk> , <unk> , and wise , like the dalai lama ?
over the course of the film we had more than 500 companies that were up and up and the &quot; no &quot; said , because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they wanted nothing to do with this movie because they had no control , no control over the finished product .
but it &apos;s going to be 17 families who were willing to get out of this control with someone who was going to do business with someone , so joy and playful , like me , and who finally came to tell us stories that we don &apos;t necessarily have been able to tell -- stories that would never have been supported by any standard .
they were reluctant to tell us the story of <unk> , just as we tell the story in this movie , that these days , you &apos;re using <unk> to make the <unk> of the brain , both for advertising and films .
we drove up to sao paulo , where <unk> was being banned .
throughout the city for five years , there &apos;s been no randomness , no poster , no rudder , nothing .
and we drove in school school where companies have their path in the impoverished schools , across america .
the amazing thing for me is that the projects where i got the most feedback , or where i have the greatest success , are the ones that i interacted with things directly .
and that &apos;s what those brands have done .
because they went to the middle man , they designed the agencies , and they said that maybe the agencies may not really have their interest in meaning .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that makes people think that our worldview will challenge .
and what was that for you ? what good ?
now , because the film had been taking the movie film festival , let &apos;s look at it .
it was a premiere in january , and since then -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million views from this film .
this actually includes a time of two and a half weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film was not going out yet .
it &apos;s not even online ; it &apos;s not lax .
it hasn &apos;t come out in other countries .
well , eventually the film really gained a huge momentum .
and that &apos;s not a project for a project where almost every charity we were talking to , they recommended their clients , they recommended their fingers .
one of the things that i think is , i think , is that if you take risks , you take risks , you take risks in those risks .
i think if you keep people from that , then you get them closer to failing .
i think that if you train your employees to avoid risks , you &apos;ve prepared the whole company to get a profit .
i feel like we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to not have fear of opportunities that maybe scare them .
finally , in progress , we should be welcoming the fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
so , welcome fear . say the risk .
there &apos;s a big taste full of spoon that &apos;s called the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
now , more than ever before , a little bit more honesty brings us .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my whole talk , &quot; is welcome transparency , &quot; from my good friends of <unk> , who spent $ 40,000 dollars on ebay for ibm .
big data is turned into big opportunities all over the world .
stew : &quot; call them transparency &quot;
thank you very much .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency , which is , what &apos;s happened to the $ 20 thousand dollars ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i put a check in my pocket , put it on the hood of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a check at $ 400 to pay for the next year .
my name is <unk> .
i did another thing at google 18 months ago , and i was forced to make something with museums and art . my favorite group , which is today , gave me green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of juggling negotiations and stories , i can tell you , at 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;ll focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
i think my personal view is very easy to explain with this slide and access to it .
i grew up in india .
i became a great education to see -- i didn &apos;t afford -- but i had too many museums , and there was no access to art .
and when i went and visited those museums , i started learning a lot .
and while i was working for google , i tried this longing -- to make art more accessible with technology .
so we started a team , a great crew , and we started with this .
i &apos;m probably going to start the demonstration and tell you some interesting things that happened since the beginning .
so you &apos;re just going to <unk> .
you can go around all these museums here .
there &apos;s the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , the van gogh .
i &apos;ve come to even one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you come in two ways -- very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , is in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
you go around and enjoy .
you want to orient in the museum ?
open the map , and jump with a click .
in there they are , they want to go to the end of the gangs .
just carry on . enjoy fun .
explore it .
thank you , but the best one is still coming .
so now i &apos;m in front of one of my favorites , ceo of pieter <unk> in the met .
i see this cliff .
if the museum gave us the picture , click on it .
now this is one of the images .
these are all metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art can click -- but i &apos;m going to throw it away now .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve obtained with what &apos;s called the <unk> .
this image , for example , has about 10 billion subscribers , i believe .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; well , what are you going to get out of 10 billion ? &quot;
now , this is what i &apos;m going to show you .
you can very easily open and <unk> .
and you see something funny there .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
but then they really want to go deep .
and so i started playing around , and i noticed there &apos;s something happening there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close , and i slowly noticed that these kids actually beat something .
i was talking a little bit , spoke with some familiar ones at the met , and actually found out that this was a game called <unk> , where a goose is beaten on the front of a stick .
it seems quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to go really close , you can go to the cracks .
just to give you a clue , i put out what you can get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best one is coming -- in a second .
so let &apos;s jump quickly at moma , again in new york .
another picture of mine , <unk> .
in the previous example , it was about finding detail .
but what if you want to see the break ?
and what happens when you want van gogh to create this masterpiece ?
you zoom in . you can actually go in .
i &apos;m going to zoom in in one of my favorite models of this image until i &apos;m really the nerd .
this is <unk> , probably never seen this way .
now , i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many other , but i don &apos;t have time .
this is the cool part , called the collections .
each of you , every one -- same is rich or poor , if you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go online and take your own museum online -- from all these pictures you can pop your own collection .
very simply , they go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it means the power of the <unk> -- they can downshift .
this is the <unk> , which is in the coalmine .
you can put it all aside , send your friends , send a conversation about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think , finally , for me , that all the wonderful things here don &apos;t come from google .
they &apos;re not even coming from the museums .
i may not say that .
they come from artists .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope we &apos;ll be working with this digital medium of art and represent them right online .
and the biggest question that i asked recently is , &quot; did you do this to replicate the experience of a steam ? &quot;
and the answer to that is no .
it &apos;s about experience .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a rendering of your brain . you can split your brain in half .
this is the left half , which is the logical side and then the right half , which is the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the outline of each hemisphere , we could map your brain .
for instance , this guy would be completely logical .
this would be somebody who is completely intuitive .
so where would you position your brain at that scale ?
some of us may have decided to be one of those extremes , but i think that for most people in the audience , their brain looks something like this -- with a high amount of control , which is at the same time in both hemispheres .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both exclusive or so .
they can be logically and intuitively .
and so i think of myself as one of those individuals , with the vast majority of experimental capacities that require good use of logic to put together the complex ideas .
but at the same time , we need a good stake to actually execute the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love playing with things .
so we go out and we play with it and then we see it react , and then we start to develop our intuition there .
they &apos;re basically doing the same thing .
so one of the intuitions that you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that one thing can be only in one place at the same time .
i mean , it might sound strange to think that one thing at the same time is in two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they developed it .
i remember looking at a kid playing on a two-wheeler .
he was still a toddler , and not very good at it , and he was constantly falling .
but i bet that it taught me playing a very precious lesson , which was that big things don &apos;t just let you keep you through it , and that you &apos;re in a position .
and this is a great child-friendly model in the world , so long as they &apos;re not a particle particle .
it would be a horrible model for a particle particle , because they don &apos;t play with toys , but with these little strange particles .
and when you play with the particles , you &apos;d find all kinds of weird things -- how they &apos;re flying right through walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time .
and so they wrote all of these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
that was the state of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little , tiny particles .
but it didn &apos;t need them to describe the large mundane objects around us .
it didn &apos;t like my intuition , and it may just be because i don &apos;t often play with particles .
well , sometimes i &apos;ll play with you , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but my logical side didn &apos;t like it either .
because when all of these things are made of particles , and all of these particles are going to follow the rules of quantum mechanics , not just all the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i can &apos;t see why it shouldn &apos;t be .
so i would feel better with the whole thing , if we could somehow show that everyday objects also follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so a few years ago , i started doing exactly that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see in the <unk> world .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see that green dot there in the middle .
that &apos;s the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about in a moment .
this is a picture of the object .
so , here i &apos;m going . we &apos;re looking at the center right here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal it &apos;s shaped like a springboard , and it &apos;s over the edge .
so i made this thing in similar ways to make a computer chip .
i went to a clean space with new myeloma , and for 100 hours on all the big devices .
for the last time , i had to build my own machine -- to get this swimming pool of shaped hole and get a thing .
and that thing has the ability to be in <unk> , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know , how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m in the elevator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then i go up other people , and i &apos;m listening to all these things , because i don &apos;t want it to offend it , or , frankly , they &apos;re <unk> .
so quantum mechanics says that karl objects feel the same way .
the fellow riders of immobile objects are not just people but the light that seems to be on them and the wind that &apos;s sweeping them by the sun and the heat of the room .
and so we knew that when we wanted to see that this piece of metal behaves , we had to pull all the way out .
and then we did that .
we turn off the lights , we put it in a vacuum , and put it all the air up to almost now , just by himself , in the elevator , was the piece of metal , the piece of metal , as it always wanted .
so we measured his movement .
we found that it was really , really strange .
instead of just lying it there , it &apos;s just like this , it &apos;s kind of like this , it &apos;s kind of like this , it &apos;s kind of like this , and it &apos;s like this , and it &apos;s kind of like this -- and it &apos;s like a <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> .
in which we gave him a little push , we could replenish it at the same time , and not to vibrate -- something that allowed only in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about is what really awesome .
what does it mean to vibrate and <unk> it for an object at the same time ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case , all the trillion of atoms out of which the piece of metal is silent , and at the same time , the same atoms go up and down .
it &apos;s just to accurate <unk> voices .
the rest of the time are <unk> .
that means that every atom at the same time is in two different places , which is at the same time that the entire piece of metal is in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth it for me for all this year in the clean space , because , check this out , the gap between one atom and the piece of metal is roughly the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom at the same time can be in two different places , that piece of metal can be in two different places , so why not it ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so , imagine you &apos;re at the same time in several places , how would that feel ?
how would your consciousness handle that your body in space is suspended ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
when we released the lights and put the lights together , we saw that the piece of metal was always in one piece .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator are actually understood only objects that are together in a small room together .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says everything is connected to everything .
now that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more to it . it &apos;s deeper than that .
it is that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that is the profound and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in the year 2007 , i decided that we should be thinking about economic development .
it should be our goal that when families think about where they live and work , they give them the opportunity to choose between at least one hand full of different cities that are all in competition for new residents .
we &apos;re far away from that goal right now .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t even have a single city that they would welcome .
but the amazing thing about cities is they &apos;re worth so much more than building them .
so we could , in fact , be able to build the world very easily , maybe hundreds of new cities .
now that may sound absurd for you , if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
just trade the construction of your apartment in cities .
imagine , half of the people who want to live in homes are already going to do this ; the other half didn &apos;t .
you could try to augment the capacity that already have existing apartments .
but you know what you would get into , in those homes and their environment , there are laws of legislation to avoid complaints and push away from the reconstruction .
so it turns out that it &apos;s very hard to meet all these extensions .
but you could go to a completely new place , build a completely new apartment block , assuming the laws there would support such a construction and not deny it .
so i &apos;ve been suggesting that governments create new areas that offer enough space for a city and gave them a name : charter cities .
i found out later that , in fact , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> about the challenge of reform in honduras .
they knew that about 75,000 years every year , they leave their land in the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to ensure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same thing in honduras .
now , at this point , people said , &quot; what happens if we put on a <unk> area of our country , what if we simply go to a message of the american embassy , a part of the canadian , and when people are going to go and work under the canadian rules , or the united states , they can work there , and they can do everything that they need to go to canada or america ? &quot;
in 2009 , for 2009 , honduras under a major period of science .
in the next <unk> election , yutaka lobo won in a shift whose program was both new and informed .
he was arguing c-3po , being <unk> .
in the meantime , i was preparing for tedglobal speaking to tedglobal .
through improvement , testing , and through the user study , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of the charter city to the basic elements .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you don &apos;t have the existing legal tissue .
we take great attention to new technologies , but for progress , it requires technologies and laws , and it &apos;s usually the laws that help us .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala , a friend of guatemala , sent the link to the tedtalk .
and that again showed him <unk> .
they were called me .
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s present this to the directors of our country ! &quot;
so , in december , we met in the boardroom of a hotel in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make sense of how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are to be .
and i used this graph to show you how valuable value is in a place like new york . remember that a area in some cases is worth thousands of dollars per square meter .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , at one point when there was a pause , and the slaveholders said , &quot; paul , maybe we could look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so , the tedtalk , in a very simple form , represents that a charter city is a place where it &apos;s the beginning of the ancient land , a <unk> that defines the laws that exist there , and the people offers the opportunity to either live under those rules or not .
so i was asked by the president of honduras who meant we need to come up with this project , that it matters , and that this is the way to continue our country .
i was asked to come to <unk> and take a talk on the fourth and fifth of january .
so i &apos;ve given another piece of facts that i &apos;ve been given , which has a graphic like this , which is trying to make sure that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very big city .
this is a picture of the city , and this sketch represents the new airport that was built in denver .
this airport alone has a place of 100 square miles .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince you , if you want to build a new city , you have to start an area of at least 1,000 square miles .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand acres .
polite is all <unk> .
the audience &apos;s faces were very serious and carefully .
the head of the congress came up , and he said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you for your talk , but may look at the tedtalk .
i have it on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that a new city offers new possibilities to people .
there would be an opportunity to live in a city that would be in honduras , instead of hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city includes new possibilities for executives .
the leaders of the government in honduras would depend on the help from <unk> , and they could benefit from their peers , who would support the laws for this charter and in implementation , that everybody can trust that the charter is actually going to catch it .
and the insight of president lobo was that the certainty of crowds that i &apos;ve thought about as a way to get foreign investors to come and build this city might be the equivalent of all the parties , honduras , who have been under fear and mistrust for many years .
we &apos;re into an area .
this image is from the place .
it literally takes a thousand square miles .
and shortly after that , on the 19th of january , you voted in congress for a change in the constitution to have an unfortunate policy that is voted for specific journals .
in a country that has just been a very good time in the past , congress was elected to a voice for this <unk> .
all parties , all factions of society , supported this .
but to be part of the constitution , it needs to be approved twice through congress .
on february 3rd , the second time with 114 was approved to a voice .
right after that election , between the 21st and 9 february , an delegation of about 30 <unk> to the two places in the world that were most interested in putting into the business of the auditorium .
one place is in south korea .
this is a picture of a large , new urban city built in south korea , in south korea , as the center of the center .
everything you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the permits .
the other place that was very active is singapore .
there are already two cities built in china , and the third is in preparation .
so , if you think about it virtually , it &apos;s where we are today .
you &apos;ve already got a <unk> , and you consider that area for the second city .
there is already a legal system that managers are being allowed to participate in , and it will also work on a external system .
a country has already offered its supreme court to provide in the court for the <unk> appeal of the organized system .
<unk> and wetness are very interested .
they even bring funding .
one thing , as you know , has already been launched , there &apos;s a lot of variation .
there are many companies that would love to put in america , especially in a place with trade trade , and there are a lot of people who would love to live there .
around the world there are 700 million people telling that they want to live continuously in another place .
a million people leave from latin america every year and migrate to the united states .
many of you are dads who leave off , leaving their families to do work , sometimes it &apos;s single mothers who have to make enough money to earn food and clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes children who are trying to find their parents , who , in some cases , have not seen any more .
so what is it for an idea to think about thinking about building a whole new city ?
or even building elements of these cities , or even spreading around the world ?
so what &apos;s the idea for this idea that every family has a choice between several cities who are in competition for new residents ?
that &apos;s an idea worth spreading .
so my friends in honduras asked me to say , thank you ted .
do you know how many decisions you make on a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i did one survey recently with over 2,000 americans , and the average set of choices , the average set of choices , is 70 .
a recent study recently was done with ceos , where she saw the ceos for a week .
and these scientists have documented the various subjects that it &apos;s engaging on and how much time they spent making decisions related to subjects .
and what they found is that the average ceo of cancer is working on <unk> assignments .
each of these topics was of course made of many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions have been achieved in nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their choices required them an hour or more of their time .
think about your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you take in the nine minutes of category for one hour ?
how good do you think they &apos;re making decisions in that ?
what i want to talk about today is one of the greatest reservoirs in our modern times , the sustainability world .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
when i ask you a question , raise up because i &apos;m blind , just your hand , if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , please , please , if i ask you a question , and your answer is , well , my first question for today is : are you ready to hear something about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was a freshman at stanford university , i went to this very , very firm store , at least at the time , it was actually exclusive .
it was a store called <unk> .
that business , it was almost like a chameleon .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and vinegar and over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen species of water -- and that was at a time when we actually drank <unk> .
i loved going to that store , but at one point i asked myself , well , how come you &apos;re never buying anything ?
here is the olive oil .
they had over 75 different varieties of oil , including those who were locked in boxes that came from thousands of years ago .
so one day i decided to go to the leader , and i asked the ladder , &quot; does this model work for you to really provide all of those options ? &quot;
and he showed up on the hood of tourists every day and typically had their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose jam for our experiment .
this is her fat duck .
they had <unk> different kinds of jam .
we set up a little tour directly right at the entrance of business .
we have six distinct flavors , or 7 different flavors of compression put together , and we looked at two things : firstly , what would more people stand up and try jam ?
there are more people left when they were 24 , about 60 percent when they were six , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at where people were more likely to buy a glass of traffic .
now we saw the opposite effect .
of those people who were standing when they were 24 , only three percent bought a glass of jam .
from the people who stayed when there were six , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of traffic .
now , if you calculate it , people would buy six times more of a glass of traffic , who they had to choose when they had 24 to choose .
now , not to choose a glass of traffic is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that it also impacts us in very repetitive decisions .
we don &apos;t choose to decide even when it comes to our best interests .
so , the theme of the day : financial savings .
so what i &apos;m going to describe to you now is a study that i conducted with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who was on the order of almost a million americans who have been looking at the decisions for survival in the entire united states .
and what we looked at was whether the number of <unk> you could have been able to do , the <unk> plan , the probability of whether it &apos;s saving for tomorrow .
and what we found was that there was a relationship in fact .
so in these plans , we had about <unk> plans that offered people between two to 59 different fund .
and what we found was that the more producers have been offered that , indeed , the participation rate was lower .
now , if you look at the extreme , the plans that offered two fund , the plans for the two fund had a cure in the 70s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that offered almost 60 fund , the u.s. boomers now dropped about the lowest percent rate .
now it turns out , even when you get more options to be able to do , even if you have more options for choice , it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate , rather than the fact that the more choices they were given , the more they owe it to inform them and to choose them .
the more opportunities they were available , the more they put their whole money in clean .
none of those extreme choices , the decisions that someone would recommend if you care about the future financial well-being .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three key consequences for people to provide more and more choices .
you emphasize the decision -- push on , even when it comes to your own best interest .
they make more worse decisions -- worse financial decisions and worse medical care decisions .
they choose more to things that they give themselves less happy , even if they make it objective better .
and the main reason for that is that we may enjoy it , perhaps , to look at these huge shelves of <unk> , mustard , tablets and traffic , but in fact , we can &apos;t be able to compare and move boundaries , and then actually do something out of the fantastic service .
so what i &apos;d like to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in various ways and various different formats -- that they can just apply in their business .
first of all , short .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never more real than today that less is less .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; limited . &quot;
you &apos;re always worried about losing yourself .
but in fact , we see it more and more and more that if you &apos;re willing to narrow up , and you &apos;re going to get out of the tangible other ways , well , there &apos;s a rise of sales , there &apos;s going to be a cost , and it &apos;s going to be a cost , and it &apos;s going to be a cost of cost , and it &apos;s going to be a loss of improvement .
as proctor and gamble , all the different head of water and <unk> species reduced from 26 to 15 percent , they were experiencing a $ 10 percent of sales .
when the golden diplomatic corporation was at the worst of all the best selling <unk> , they found that profits by 87 percent -- a result of the two , the rise of sales and reducing cost .
you know , the average average robot today is offering you 45,000 products .
a typical wal-mart gives you 100,000 products today .
but the most profound supermarket , today &apos;s most violent supermarket in the world , is <unk> , and they offer them just 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in a blob .
now , in the world of engineering , i believe one of the best examples that came out of the market recently is how to do the best choice in the world , was something that david <unk> has very strong , which is a program being offered at harvard .
now , every one of harvard employees is automatically taking place in a more mature mode .
those who really want to make a choice will be offered 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know , people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to cut it .
they &apos;re all important opportunities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities of each other are different .
and if their employees can &apos;t pass them , their customers can &apos;t . &quot;
now , before having lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he was willing to offer all the people in this audience a <unk> vacation on the nicest street in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i &apos;d like to read them to you .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read you , and i ask you to clap if you &apos;re willing to take gary &apos;s supply .
okay . everyone who is willing to take gary &apos;s supply .
are they all ?
all right , let me show you a little bit more of that .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for that journey .
i think i may have heard more hands .
all right .
in fact , the first thing that you look at is the first time that you had more information than the second time , but i would dare to make it a real clue for the second time .
because the pictures made it real for them .
and what brings me to the second technology that helps me deal with the problem of climate change is to address it .
and the point is that people need to understand the difference between opportunities , to understand what the consequences are associated with , and that these consequences have to be stagnant and concrete .
why are people giving up about 15 to 30 percent more if they use a television card or a card card than cash ?
because we don &apos;t really feel money .
and it turns out that if you make it a little concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool to make people save more .
so in a study that i &apos;ve done with shlomo benartzi and alessandro <unk> , we &apos;ve done a study with the people at <unk> -- employees who &apos;ve been all working for <unk> -- and these people were all in a gathering where they signed up their participation for their teammates .
and during that meeting , we &apos;ve been leaving this meeting just as it used to be , but we just added one little thing .
the small thing we added to , though , was that we asked people to think of all positive things that would happen in their lives if they save money .
in which we did this simple thing , there was an increase in participation by 20 percent , and there was a rise of the number of people who were willing to save or an increase by four percent of the amount that they were willing to pay for the savings accounts .
third technology : atalanta .
we can better deal with more categories than more choices .
for example , this is a study we did in a field of furniture .
it turns out that it varies in the <unk> industry , and down in the northeast range , it varies the number of <unk> different kinds of papers to <unk> newsprint .
but you know what ?
when i show you 600 magazines and you put them in 10 categories , or i &apos;m going to show you 400 magazines , and these in 20 categories , you think i &apos;ve given you more choice , and i &apos;ve given you a better version , when i &apos;ve given you the 400 of the 400 .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
so here are two different watt-hours .
one is called jazz , and the other is called &quot; fingertips . &quot;
if you think the left display is motor and it &apos;s the readout on the right , clap your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think that the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right side is you clap , please clap .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is jazz , and it &apos;s on the right , but you know what ?
this is a highly dense feat .
the categories have to say something that matters , not to make the choice .
and you see that problem often , if you look at the long lists of all of these fund .
who do you actually want to inform with that ?
my fourth technology : terms of complexity .
it turns out , in fact , we can actually deal with more information than we think , we just simplify them .
we have to slowly increase complexity .
let me show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buy a car .
here &apos;s a german juicer that offers you the opportunity to <unk> your car completely .
they have to make 62 different decisions to create their car completely .
now , these decisions are different in the number of choices they offer per decision .
<unk> , arms of the car -- i have 56 opportunity .
engines , gears -- four possibilities .
what i &apos;m doing now is i change the order in which decisions appear .
half of the customers are going to be done by the many possibilities , 56 <unk> to the small possibilities , four gears .
the other half of the customers go from the small possibilities , four gears , to the 56 <unk> , many possibilities .
what do i look at ?
how interested they are .
if you constantly use the <unk> of the decision , it means that you &apos;re being overwhelmed , you &apos;re <unk> , i &apos;m losing it .
what you find is that the people who are going to go from a lot of those at low levels is over and over again .
we lose them .
if you go from the little choice to the many , you &apos;re staying .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing that i did is to change the sequence in which this information is present .
when i start to do the simple thing , i &apos;m learning how i &apos;m selecting .
even though the gears choose to tell me nothing about my preferences in the interior , it just keeps me chose .
i also get excited about the big product that i &apos;m left , and so i &apos;m willing to motivate myself to be interested in it .
let me wrap it up .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that address the problem of climate change -- just -- just -- they &apos;re going to go out of excess alternatives ; <unk> -- make it real ; maps -- we can better deal with more categories , less possibilities , in complexity .
every one of these techniques i &apos;d like to describe to you today is to help them manage the opportunities -- good for you , you can use it for yourself , good for the people that you service for service .
because i think the key to the best choice is you &apos;re choosing to be choosing .
and the more we choose to choose , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> at youtube . i &apos;m looking at <unk> .
that &apos;s right .
today we want to talk about how videos are , and then , therefore , it &apos;s important .
we all want to be stars -- race , singer , comedians -- when i was young , it seemed so infinitely hard .
but video games have allowed us to be considered all of our creative activities , in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you may be famous on the internet until next saturday .
but at youtube , more than 48 hours of video uploaded each minute .
and again , just a tiny percentage ever goes virally and will be looked at thousands of times and so on the cultural moment .
so how does it work ?
three things : barbers , deepest-diving and the unexpected .
well , let &apos;s do that .
oh , my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
yay !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year , kaijen <unk> would send this video that he &apos;d photographed in the yosemite national park in the yosemite national park .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
this chart shows what it looked like when the video was first popular for the first summer .
in fact , no viral video didn &apos;t want a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you can do it in a way that &apos;s called the yosemite mountain <unk> .
he had put up a lot of ultrasounds .
and this video was actually sent to january .
so what happened here ?
there was jimmy schumlin .
jimmy raibert would send the tweet , which made the video so popular .
because <unk> like jimmy robins ask us new and interesting things , and show a large audience .
it &apos;s friday , friday . <unk> get down down to friday . all of you , you know , friday , friday . <unk> &apos; down to friday . you didn &apos;t think we were going to have that conversation without speaking about this video , i hope .
rebecca pugh &apos;s friday is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it &apos;s been viewed for almost 200 million times this year .
this is what the graphics looked like .
it seems to be just like &quot; those double <unk> , &quot; it seems to be from nothing .
what &apos;s happened that day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
if you want to know it , these other spikes are also <unk> .
but what about that day , that particular friday ?
well , <unk> <unk> it up , a lot of blogs started writing about it .
michael j. nelson wurman was a first one who made a joke on twitter on this .
what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of <unk> had entered a point of view , with a large audience and accelerated the process .
and then this community formed by people who shared these big , and started talking about it and playing with it .
now there &apos;s 10,000 hours of &quot; friday &quot; on youtube .
for the first seven days , there was a spoof for every single day week .
unlike the 20th century , the community part of our community is to become part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it up or making something new .
<unk> cat is animation and music in <unk> .
that &apos;s it , really simple .
this year it was viewed almost 50 million times .
and if you think that &apos;s crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s been looked at four million times .
and even cats are looking at this video .
cats look at cats looking at this video .
the important thing is , the creativity that has been in the <unk> community and geeks .
there was confirmation .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
an entire <unk> shot out of the ground that made it from a stupid joke to something that we all participate in .
now we don &apos;t just find pleasure on something we &apos;re doing .
who could anticipate all this ?
who could have predicted &quot; double <unk> , &quot; or rebecca , or can we predict ?
what kind of economists did you think they could write in doing this sort of thing ?
in a world where each minute of video is uploaded , it can only really be unique and unexpected <unk> as i mentioned .
i mean , i wasn &apos;t really interested in that when a friend said i had to look at this wonderful video , about a guy who deals in new york against bicycles .
i got a traffic ticket , because i didn &apos;t get on the ticket , but a lot of times there &apos;s a lot of disability that you &apos;re not very eager to drive on .
since this was completely surprising and humorous , casey xiaoping &apos;s idea was invented and his argument was five million times .
so this approach applies to everything we &apos;re creative about .
and all of this leads to a big question .
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , completely unexpected , are the features of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has very kindly determined in the audience .
as i said , one of the biggest stars -- justin bieber -- did his beginning at youtube .
nobody has to give your ideas green .
and today we all feel as the owners of our pop culture .
and these are not the features of the old media , and they &apos;re hardly meeting the media of today , but they &apos;re going to determine the entertainment of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about the connectedness between women in three generations , and how the astonishing strength of those connectedness in the life of a four year-old girl , when she was sitting over 30 years ago with her little sister , her mother and her grandmother , was sitting in a small boat in the chinese sea , a connectedness that was stuck in the life of this little girl , and never disappeared -- this little girl who lives in san francisco and talks to them today ?
the story isn &apos;t over yet .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still being put together .
i want to tell you about some of the projects .
imagine the first piece : a man who burns his life &apos;s work .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man who has been together with the simple hope of unity and freedom of his home .
think of him as the communists of the communists in <unk> , as he turns out , his life was a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , he <unk> his friends .
he pulled back into silence .
he died through history .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met it personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never made me know his life .
i had to make sure that it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job to learn that the story was not trying to humanize us , but it was through .
the next piece of puzzle shows how a boat in the early 1500s stop in lake .
my mom may be 18 when her father died -- in a <unk> marriage , already two little girls .
for her , life had given her a challenge : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was completely excluded that she could fail to do that .
after a four four and a half professor , karl <unk> , a boat stopped a silent boat .
all adults were aware of the risks .
the greatest fear was in front of pirate , rape and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother wore a little <unk> .
first of all , my sister and i drank myself and my grandmother from that .
my first memory is from this boat -- the healthy <unk> of the engine , the slapping of every wave on the bow , the vast and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates that came in many times , but i would let the men puzzled from the men on our boat , or at the expense of the engine that six hours didn &apos;t want to start .
but i remember the lights on the coast of the coast coast , and the young man who collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first apple , who gave me one of the men on the platform .
no apple tasted again like this .
three months in the refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and the next set of data is about four women in three generations building together a new life .
we &apos;d let ourselves down in <unk> , one of the works populated suburban , which is the population of <unk> .
unlike the <unk> <unk> , whose existence was totally unknown to me , there was no motorcade in <unk> .
the odors from the <unk> came from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> broken <unk> have been shared between people that had one thing in common : they started fresh .
my mother worked on farms , then on a assembly line in a <unk> , six days , double layers .
it kind of managed to find their time to have english and <unk> .
we were poor .
every dollar has been established and was put into more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to do for it . mostly the new things that came out of the second hand .
two pair of <unk> for school , each to drop the holes up in the other .
a <unk> to the <unk> , because she had to stretch six years .
and there were the rare , but painful choirs of &quot; <unk> , &quot; and here , &quot; asians , go home . &quot;
where ?
something refreshing inside me .
there was a celebration meeting to reconciliation and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;ll go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we were told each other from our day and listening to the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother was suffering from the boat .
and it was my job of staying awake every night until your <unk> came , so i could awaken you .
and she opened up a computer business , and then he went and launched a business business .
and women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t change change , angry and <unk> , and <unk> kids , trapped between two worlds .
loans and nurses were seeking .
centers have been built .
i lived in <unk> .
in one of them , i was the classic asian student who introduced <unk> demands for themselves .
in the others , i was involved in insecure life , the tragic scars of the violence , the peace and the insulation .
but there were so many people in aid .
and for that aid , i was chosen in my last year of <unk> as a young governor of the year .
and i was catapulted from a hydrophone to the next , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anonymous <unk> of <unk> , refugee le , refugee and social activist who was invited to speak of places that had never heard of , and in homes that they could never imagine .
i was not familiar with the hearing condition .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to routine and comfort of the life of an unknown <unk> -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who were borrowing every day of their day for 20 years , by telling each other stories of their day and <unk> , we still were in the same bed .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do it .
she reminded me that i was as old as she was at the time that we climbed the boat .
no , it was never an opportunity .
&quot; do it simple , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i was talking about compliance and training , and the neglect of the <unk> and <unk> .
and the more open i talked , the more i should tell .
i met people in all walks meetings , so many of them did what they loved lived on the boundaries of the possible .
and even though i graduated from my degree , i realized that i couldn &apos;t address myself with a career in law .
there had to be another kind of argument .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a outsider , a <unk> , new picture -- and not just okay , but something you have to be grateful for , maybe a gift of the boat .
because <unk> can lead to the collapse of horizons so easily that you accept the assumptions of the environment .
now , i &apos;ve gone enough from my dinner meeting to know that , yes , the world is dropping out , but not the way you fear .
opportunities that would not have been allowed were explicitly encouraged .
there was a energy , a functional optimism , a strange mixture of the humility and the <unk> .
so i followed my gut feeling .
i collected a little team of people around me to the box , &quot; not a terribly challenging challenge .
we didn &apos;t have a dime for one year .
at the end of each one , i was cooking a huge soup of soup that we shared .
we worked late to the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but there were some brilliant people , and we got the breakthrough .
i made the decision to go to the united states .
just a journey there .
my gut feeling again .
three months later i moved , and the adventure went on .
now , before i finish this talk , i &apos;d like to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time when the social norm and the local was mandarin the most important person .
life had not changed for centuries .
her father died shortly after she was born .
her mother was just raising her alone .
at 17 , she was devastated the second woman of an accident whose mother beat her .
with no support of her husband , she cared for an awful force by bringing him to trial and she was in her own case , and a bigger feel than she won .
&quot; proved to be a untrue .
i was in a hotel hotel in sydney , when she died . 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked at the <unk> and looked at them on the other side .
i knew she &apos;d come to say goodbye .
so my mother got me a few minutes afterwards .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around her coffin .
we told her stories , and told her we were still with her .
by midnight , the monk came and said he had to break the coffin .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of you is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because you &apos;ve been holding them this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; they <unk> them . &quot;
if there is a band in our family , it &apos;s by the women .
if you see who we were and how life shapes us , we can now see that the men who might have come to our lives would have come to our hands .
the defeat was too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i &apos;m thinking about the boat .
who ever would one wish ?
yeah , i am afraid of privilege , from ease , from ancient scientists .
can i give you a bug in your life , the brave of all the wave departments , the <unk> , healthy uses of the engine , the vast horizon , that has no guarantee ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this and make it safe , i would do it .
and also , min &apos;s mother is here in the fourth or fifth line .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it any photography at all ?
because this is , of course , a picture you can &apos;t take on your camera .
and yet , my interest in photography was when i got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
i discovered it with my former predilection for drawing , but it was a little different , because when you use the camera , the process was really in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends up when you squeeze on the trigger .
so for me , photography seemed to be more about being at the right place at the right time .
i thought everybody could do that .
so i wanted to create something else , something that the process is starting when the cause is maintained .
photos like this : this one , along a much <unk> road .
but it &apos;s got an unexpected twist .
and yet , even a realistic level .
or take pictures like this -- dark and <unk> at the same time , but all with the common goal to keep a realistic level .
when i say reality , i mean <unk> .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can actually catch , but i &apos;d always like to let it look like you can , in a photograph .
photographs where you have to think about a brief moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than really a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about the light ?
what makes the illusion ?
and sometimes the illusion is the illusion .
but in the end , it &apos;s about how we &apos;re interpreting the world , and how it can be added in a two-dimensional area .
it &apos;s not about what realistic is , but what we think is realistic .
so , i think the essentials are very simple .
i see it as a puzzle of reality , where you can take various pieces and assemble them together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfect problems that we can all relate to here in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , combined , you can do something that still looks more three-dimensional than if it may exist .
but at the same time , we know that that &apos;s not possible .
so we interpret our brains , because our brains simply don &apos;t really make sense , it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combining pictures .
it &apos;s really about combining different realities .
so the things that make a picture realistic , i think it &apos;s the things we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our everyday lives .
but if we take pictures together , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because it &apos;s just kind of false .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to obey a realistic outcome .
and as you can see , these are not three special pictures .
so , you can combine something special like this .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same point of view .
second of all , common photos should have the same .
and those two pictures fulfill these two demands -- shot at the same altitude , shot the same thing .
third , it &apos;s not possible to make it possible to tell where the individual pictures start and end by connecting them seamlessly .
make it impossible to say how the photo was actually put together .
so by contrast , contrast , and contrast , by the margins , the individual images , the single images of immersion , photographic deprivation and disorders , we put the boundaries between the different images and let them look like a single photograph , even though a picture can contain hundreds of layers .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think this is just a landscape , and the lower part was manipulated .
now this image is completely sealed , taken pictures of different places .
personally , i personally believe that it &apos;s easier to create a place than to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to make trade-offs with the ideas in your head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew that i needed several months to plan to find the various places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish was recorded on a barge .
the bank is from a different place .
it &apos;s from a quarry .
and yes , i even got the house up on the island of red in red to make it look swiss .
so to get a realistic result , it &apos;s just from me to design .
i always start with a kind of spirit , an idea .
and then it &apos;s about combination of the different images .
and here &apos;s a very good piece of planned .
and if you make good shots , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also very realistic .
so there are all the tools there , and the only thing that can occur is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic <unk> fail .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking with our patients .
and one of the things that we introduced in the field of brazil was that we could do a <unk> net .
and she doesn &apos;t talk very well -- she puts a cup of coffee or tea and asks patients , families , related , &quot; how about that ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why everybody -- probably most of the electronic failed fail , because we stopped listening .
this is my <unk> . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
she &apos;s got a button , and she &apos;s off .
and every morning i click on it .
and yeah , i have a task , as you might recognize .
i shaved my job at 95 kilos .
it works very simple : every time i step on the scale , it will send my data to google health .
and they &apos;re also going to compensate from my <unk> , so that he can see where my homegirl is , and not only the moment that i need a support of support or something , but also a view in the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you know that , i have over 4,000 <unk> on twitter .
so every morning i click on my <unk> , and people talk to me before i sit in the car , &quot; for lunch , i don &apos;t have a little lettuce today , <unk> . &quot;
but that &apos;s the kind of thing that can happen , because this is a peer peer pressure , to help patients , because this could be used against obesity , or it might take patients smoking .
it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and get them to play together any kind of game to better control their health .
every week , this is the market .
there &apos;s going to be this little test configuration that you put in an iphone or something .
and it will enable people to measure their blood pressure , send them to their blood pressure , and to share it for example , for example , for more than 100 dollars .
so at that point , the patients come in . they can &apos;t just take control , they can be captain on their own ship , but can also help us in the face of the challenges that are ahead of us , and the quality of health care , and so on .
make methods easy to use and start embracing patients in the team with this one .
and they can do that through these techniques , but also through crowdsourcing .
and one of the things that we did is share with you through a very short video .
we all have crops in our cars .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
we really know where all the atm machines are around the ocean .
we know one more where all the stations are .
and sure enough , we can find randomness .
but where would the next decision date to help this patient ?
we have <unk> , and no one knew .
nobody knew where to find the next contractors in the moment .
so what did we do ? we did crowdsourcing in the netherlands .
we set up a website , and we asked a crowd , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please share us where he is , &quot; because sometimes he was closed at <unk> , of course .
and over 10,000 people have been reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for this .
and we created a design company .
we &apos;ve developed an app for <unk> , augmented reality to find these kinds of areas .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> and someone is collapsing , you can use your iphone , and within the next couple of weeks , your urge for life can be saved to save life .
and then , today , we don &apos;t just want to take this as a <unk> , as the product is called itself , but also to introduce as a <unk> .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
and we &apos;re asking our colleagues around the world , from other universities , about helping us behave like acting in order to crowdsource these incidents around the world .
and when you &apos;re on vacation and you &apos;re collapsing , it &apos;s your own familiarity or somebody else , you can find a <unk> .
the other thing that we want to ask for is that companies all over the world help us in the reconstruction of these therapies .
those might be <unk> , or technicians , for example , just to make sure that the <unk> still is still in its place .
please help us and try and make the health not just better , but take the hand .
thank you .
today , i &apos;m going to be covering unexpected discoveries .
i work in <unk> .
and my little puzzle system wants us to force ourselves to make sure ...
... you can get the tutor .
so here &apos;s a quick video of what we &apos;re doing .
oh , a moment .
it may take until it &apos;s round .
now , we can just jump through that -- i &apos;ll just skip the video .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design , take a year off and work in an environment that is pretty much everything that they really hate , we have been working in government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like playing a video game for america .
we choose some fellows every year and we let them work with <unk> .
instead of sending them to the third world , we send them in <unk> .
and they developed great apps , worked with urban employees .
but what they really do is show what &apos;s possible with technology today .
so you meet al .
al is a propagandist in the city of boston .
so what it looks like is that he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is someone who <unk> him , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at 9 feet from a meter of snow .
how did he get to look for this particular kind of help ?
we had a team of fellows last year in boston , bringing the code for america .
they were there in february , and last february , they got much more crafty .
and they realized that the city never <unk> these fire fires .
but one particular fellow , a guy named erik meiselas , noticed something else , and that was that the cops are holding the sidewalks out of the sidewalks , right in front of these .
so he did what every good developers would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
you make it freely <unk> if it snows .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take you off .
so there &apos;s a nice little dynamic game .
this is a very humble little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that fellows have written in the last year .
but she does something that no other particle does .
it spreads rapidly .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> department of the city , who has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but to adopt the citizens of <unk> .
it &apos;s very important that these stradivarius work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got citizens to check her .
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the people to clean their cots down .
and chicago has just introduced it to allow people to degrade when it snows .
now we know nine cities that plan to use these app .
and it &apos;s been very smoothly , organic , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you don &apos;t normally know that way .
so making software making the rule a few years believe .
we had a team working last year in boston , working for three people two and a half months .
it was about a way to figure out what the right public schools are for their children .
we were told later that if it was going over the normal channels , it would have taken over two years and it cost about two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
there &apos;s now a project in california law , which has cost the taxpayer two billion dollars yet , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of the government .
so an app written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spreading by <unk> , is a kind of a sequence in front of the front of the government .
it shows how the government could work better -- not more like a private company , how many people think it should be .
and not even like a <unk> , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , that means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , this app is that it represents a new generation tackling the government problem -- not as a problem of an intentional institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and that &apos;s a very good news , because it turns out we are very good in collective computation with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a great community of people who are using the tools that we need to effectively tackle things together .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , &quot; there are hundreds of people all over the country who write up and <unk> , every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they are horribly frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it , they fix it .
and these guys know something that we &apos;ve lost from our eyes .
and that is , if you all forget about politics and the snake snake and all the other things that we really upset about is government , in the core , in the words of tim o &apos; says , &quot; what we do together , we can &apos;t do it alone . &quot;
today , a lot of people got abandoned .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i want you to pay attention to it because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; government is in change .
and because the government finally takes their power out of us -- <unk> you : &quot; we &apos;re the people ? &quot; as we think about it , changes how that change happens .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
and how many people , i thought , was basically about choosing people in office .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s especially in local communities to travel .
this is the call center for service and information .
that &apos;s where you normally get out when you desired in your city .
if you &apos;ve ever got the chance to work in your environment call , like our fellow scott <unk> , as part of the program -- in fact , do all of that -- you &apos;ll see that the people , the government , because of many different problems , is that there is a force in your house .
so scott gets this meggendorferitis .
he &apos;s typing &quot; <unk> &quot; to the official database .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he begins with the goldfish .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the livestock is going to wash ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but that was not the end of the cheerleaders .
in boston , it &apos;s not just a call center .
it has an app , a zoning and <unk> institution , called the citizens citizens .
we didn &apos;t write the app .
this is the work of very smart people at the office of the new urban climate city in boston .
one day -- this is an actual report -- came in , &quot; <unk> in my trash . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
how do you get it from ? &quot;
but what happens to the citizens of citizens is different .
scott was a person born to human .
but citizens in citizens are all public so anybody can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next entry we got was , &quot; i went over there , found the garbage garbage behind the house .
<unk> ? yes . alive ? seductress .
and the trash trash turned back . went home .
good night , <unk> <unk> . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital effect .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how to get the government into crowdsourcing .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m more talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
one citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central role here .
and they connected these two people .
and you could be able to connect them with government services if they were needed , but a neighbor is a much better and cheaper alternative to state services .
when one neighbor helps the other , we strengthen our communities .
let &apos;s call it a push , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we have to think about it , that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they believe that one is the other input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is to vote .
how often do we choose a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we settled back and we expect the government to reflect our values and match our needs , and then not much changed ?
that &apos;s because the government is like an ocean and politics are the top ever .
and what &apos;s underneath is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use that word to contempt .
but this is the contempt that we have , and that we pay for , to be something that works against us , something else , and then we refuse ourselves .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
if we want that institution to work for us , we need to make bureaucracy sexy .
because this is where the work ethic is happening .
we need to engage in government &apos;s engines .
so the <unk> did it .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concerned of the concerned that has written a very detailed set of information reports , which is an answer to the world &apos;s worth of information .
this is not politically active , that &apos;s systemic active .
now , for those of us who have given up the government , it &apos;s time to think about the world we want to leave our children .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to face .
do we really believe that we can reach what we have to do without improving an institution based on all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary but it needs to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible , the function of government function fundamentally in a way that can actually do something by empowering society .
and there &apos;s one generation that has grown up the internet , and they know it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you just have to build the right systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost one generation older than most of you are .
this is a generation who grew up seeing her voice for granted .
they &apos;re not fighting this battle that we &apos;re all fighting for , about who &apos;s going to speak ; they &apos;re allowed to speak .
you can make your opinion , on every channel at every time , and you do it .
so if you &apos;re confronted with the problem of government , you &apos;re not so concerned about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the government &apos;s work .
and these apps allow our hands to improve our communities .
it might be , a fire hydrant , a weed , a weed , turn a trash trash against a metal blade .
and sure , we would have used these fire bags all the time , and a lot of people do .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we are not only consumers , and we are not just consumers who are paying taxes and receiving services .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we will not improve government until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i have for all of you here : if the big , important things that we have to do together , all of us together are going to be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
usually my role in explaining to people is how wonderful the new technologies that are going to be , and i thought , because i &apos;m here among friends , i would tell you what i really think , and also try to look back and understand what &apos;s really going on here with these incredible <unk> ahead , which will quickly happen , that we can barely keep up .
i &apos;m going to start showing you a very , very boring slide .
... can you show just the slide please .
this is a slide that i accidentally selected from my folder .
i &apos;m not talking about the details of the slide , but about the general form .
this slide shows an analysis of the analysis of <unk> processors to the power of an invading area of networks .
now the interesting thing here is that this slide , like so many of the others that we find in our field , are a kind of a <unk> curve .
in other words , every step here corresponds to a potency in the coalmine .
and this is a novelty that we need to use this type of scale on <unk> curves in technology .
something very strange happens here .
so this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about .
so , if you can turn the lights back again .
a little bit brighter , because i &apos;m going to draw a little bit on the paper here .
so why do we draw graphs in technology on <unk> curves ?
the reason for that is , if i was to draw it on a normal curve , where , say , this is the years , the timeline of a kind , and this is a random pattern of the technology that i want to point out with a graph , so that makes the graph silly .
they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
so if i want to record a different technology , let &apos;s say a <unk> , that would be very irrational on the measured scale , in the form of a flat line .
but if something like this happens , it changes the transformative conditions .
so if the <unk> would be as fast as the geographical progression , we could go into a taxi , and in 30 seconds , we would be in tokyo .
but it doesn &apos;t do that fast .
this has never been before in the history of science history , this kind of <unk> growth , which the order of the scale will increase exponentially .
the question i want to ask you is , if you look at these exponential curves , you can &apos;t see they &apos;re not going on forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything forever and forever evolves as fast as now .
there are two choices .
either it will be a classic <unk> like here , until something completely new comes , or it will happen here .
that &apos;s sort of what it is .
now , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think in the way that this is going to happen .
it really is , that means that we &apos;re right now in the middle of a transition right now .
we are here on this line , in a transition transition from the far world to a new kind of world .
so the question that i &apos;d like to ask you , and i often do , is how this new world will be ?
what is this new state that takes the world slowly ?
because the transition seems to be very , very confusing when you &apos;re in the middle of the inside .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in 2000 , and people often talk about what would happen in the year 2000 .
so now we have a conference here where people talk about the future , and you realize the future is still in 2000 .
we &apos;re not going to go further than that .
so in other words , the future has declined by a year since i &apos;m in the world .
i think the reason for that is that we realize something is happening .
the transition happens . we can feel it all .
and we know that at the moment , it just doesn &apos;t make sense at the moment of trying to look at 30 or 50 years into the future , because everything will be so different that a simple creeks from what we &apos;re just doing doesn &apos;t make sense .
i want to talk to you about what that might be that transition that we &apos;re at the moment .
to do that , i first &apos;m going to talk about some other things that have nothing to do with technology or computers .
because i think to really understand this , we need to take a step back and look at the thing on a longer scale of research .
and that is , i want to look at this on the edges of life on earth .
i think the complete picture makes sense when you divide it into some sweet types .
so let &apos;s go back , and it was one and a half billion years ago , and earth was a big , <unk> eeg system with lots of them floating chemicals .
now , if you look at the way that these chemicals were organized , it gives us a pretty good picture of how they feel about it .
i think there are also theories that start understanding how everything started rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit of a simplistic story of which is , at that time , small oil droplet , which contain different kinds of prescriptions for chemicals .
some of these oil spills have a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from outside and thus grow .
these were all , they started to divide themselves .
these little oil droplet were the most prolific oil droplet in the sense .
but these oil droplet were not about living in the same sense that , because each one of them was just a little , crisis-driven prescription of chemicals .
and every time it divided , it turned out to be chemical quantities of chemical chemicals .
so every ship was slightly different .
in fact , the droplet of extraction , which was one for growth of industrial engineering faster than others and integrated more and more chemicals from the outside and shared faster .
so these tended to survive longer , and it repeats an incredible degree .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interestingly , when this droplet has learned a trick about abstraction .
in any way , which we don &apos;t quite understand yet , this droplet has the ability to explore information .
they have learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , in a certain chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , you &apos;ve found a way in which you &apos;ve been able to figure out a way that allowed them to become <unk> , so that this information could save and copied .
and the amazing thing is that this kind of information has to store over the period of 2.5 billion years , where it was born , right ?
in fact , the recipe for us is our genes , which is exactly the same code and the same notation .
and that is that every being uses the exact same letter and the same code .
we are so far that , just for the sake of the day , we can write anything in this code .
and i &apos;ve got 100 <unk> of a white <unk> , which i &apos;m trying to keep in airports .
it &apos;s in there -- what i &apos;ve done is i took this code -- the code is made of normal letters that we use to talk -- and i wrote my card card on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve made 10 ^ 22 times more powerful .
so if somebody wants a hundred million copies of my business card , i have enough for everybody in this room , and even for everyone in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i had been in reality , i would have put it on a virus and released it in the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dna model of dna was an interesting step .
and those cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another very interesting step , very interesting step , where things were completely different , and so these cells started communicating and exchanging information so that communities were born by cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that already , but bacteria can actually exchange dna .
that &apos;s also why , for example , it grows into antibiotics .
some bacteria have figured out how to drag away from penicillin , and have this information written with other bacteria in the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate with each other .
now that communication allowed the reasons of communities that were in the same boat in some sense ; they were resigned .
so they either survived together , or they went together , and that meant that if there was a community successful , all individuals of the community were repeated more often and by evolution .
the <unk> is now where these communities are so close to so close that they decided to write the prescription for the whole community on the dna .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
at that point , we have <unk> communities , communities of many <unk> , who act together as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also a <unk> community .
we have a lot of cells that are not left anymore .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities began to develop so that the level in which the evolution was occurring , it was no longer the single cell , but the entire amount of information that we &apos;re calling .
so the next step was happening within these communities .
the elizabethans began to abstract information .
and they developed special structures that did nothing else than to process information within the organism .
and these are neural structures .
so the neurons are the wiki neurons that have built these stradivarius up .
they started to train specialists within the community , special structures that were responsible for learning , understanding and capturing information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave you an evolutionary advantage .
because at that moment , an individual -- learning happened within the time of the lifespan of a single organism , rather than this evolutionary period of time .
so for example , one organism could learn to eat a particular fruit , because she liked badly and made sick , the last time he ate them .
now this could have been done within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years ago , because this information has been inspired by the individuals who died because of these nuclear weapons .
so , the nervous system has the input in dealing with this particular notion of view , because evolution could now have within an individual .
it could happen within a time of time .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms find a way to communicate with each other .
so for example , the <unk> version of us is the human language .
it &apos;s an amazing invention , if you think about it .
i have a very complicated , evocative and flummoxed idea in my head here .
and i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m basically giving an awkward sound of mine , hoping to create a similar kind of puzzled idea in your mind that has some resemblance to my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , turn it into sound , a sequence of sound , and make something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to do this again as a kind of a biased organism .
and what we &apos;ve done , we , is , we started abstract .
we through the same stages that have gone through waste levels -- the abstraction of our methods to capture the data .
the invention of language for example was a little step in that direction .
<unk> , computers , <unk> , cd-roms and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to overcome that information .
and it connects us all together to something that &apos;s much bigger , and it &apos;s able to continue to develop faster than we &apos;ve been .
so today , evolution at the time of microseconds can happen .
you &apos;ve seen <unk> little <unk> , where he showed a little bit of evolution in the <unk> program , right in front of your eyes .
so now we have <unk> again .
the first steps of history i told you took a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , lasted several hundred million years .
then the most sophisticated steps , like language and so on , lasted less than one million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , are just about few decades .
it &apos;s a process that is feeding itself , and it &apos;s going to be , i think , <unk> is the word for it -- when something is more powerful .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this explosion .
we see the process that lives on itself .
i &apos;m living a lot of my life from building computers , and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism that i &apos;m using to build computers , not without the recent ever dramatic advances in computing .
my current work is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible for me to design these in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor in the coalmine does .
it has billions of them .
what i do instead , and what the designers of thinking work on , is that we think of a certain level of control , we can take this machine , and the machine is doing something that way beyond our capabilities , better and faster than we could ever do .
and it makes it partly by the ways that we don &apos;t even understand .
a method which is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve been using recently , is evolution itself .
and in doing so , we install a laser sensor in the machine that &apos;s in the operating room .
to give you an example , in most extreme cases , we can create a program that &apos;s developed out of random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , <unk> hundred million randomly chosen sequences .
now , i want to lead all of these randomly chosen instructions , run out all the programs , and pick those who are closest to me . &quot;
so in other words , i first define what i want .
let &apos;s say i want to make numbers , that would be a simple example i &apos;ve used for that .
so find programs that can rank the most numbers .
of course , the chance of randomly elected instructions is very small that at random they &apos;ll just bump out numbers , so i guess the instructions will actually do this .
but one of them may be two numbers in the right order .
now , i say , &quot; computers , take those 10 percent of the sequences that come to the next one .
conserve it down , flip the rest .
now , all the cardiac accidents that the numbers put in the best run out .
and with a method of dealing , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs , and they &apos;re producing kids through the exchange of their peers , and the kids are revealing the properties of the group of the two programs .
so now i have a new generation of programs that have come out of combinations of programs that have come slightly closer to policies than others .
you say , &quot; please have this process . &quot;
fix them .
may have some mutations .
and try again with another generation .
all of those generations need a few milliseconds .
and so i can run a evolution through millions of years in the computer in less minutes , or in some more complex cases .
and finally , i get programs that can rank numbers perfectly .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever write by hand .
and when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
they &apos;re arcane and curious programs .
but they do the job .
i know and i &apos;m sure they do the job , because they come from a series of <unk> programs that do the job .
because your life depended on if you did the job right .
i sat in a 747 with marvin minsky once , he renamed a card , and he says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
it says , &quot; this plane is made up of <unk> <unk> , which are working together to make your flight safer . isn &apos;t it just doesn &apos;t matter ? &quot;
we know a developmental process isn &apos;t optimal when it becomes too complicated .
so we start to rely on computers for a process that is very different from the classical engineering process .
it allows us to do things with much higher complexity than the normal methods would allow you to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the opportunities yet .
so it really summarizes the technology .
we use these programs now to make the computers much faster so that we can do these processes even faster .
so , there &apos;s a feedback .
it &apos;s going to be faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it &apos;s so confusing .
because these new technologies today are feeding themselves .
we raise input .
we &apos;re at a point , we &apos;re at a point where the analog is evolved at the time .
so we are the infamous , and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell we &apos;re actually creating .
we &apos;re in the middle of that wreckage .
but i really believe that something is coming .
i think it &apos;s very profound to say that we are the beginning of evolution .
and i think we all here are part of the creation of whatever next is coming next .
well , the lunch gets off before , and i think i &apos;m listening here now , before i &apos;ll get back .
my story starts in rajasthan , in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was underneath the sky in the desert with <unk> <unk> ali .
we talked about nothing changing since the time of the ancient indian foreign wars &quot; mahabharata . &quot;
if we were to go to indians then , we put in a car and we put it across the sky .
now we do this with airplanes .
at the time , when the great indian <unk> motorcycle was , he took a bow , slammed into the floor and water .
now we &apos;re going to do this with folding machines and machines .
we came up with the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
that made me really sad .
i got a fear of technology .
i was afraid that i could lose the ability to enjoy sunset without camera , without tweet to my friends .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver <unk> .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the most serious thing for me .
it became a leading access to a world full of pirate and <unk> ships and images in my mind .
it seemed to me that when we thought our fancy clocks and cameras started dreaming .
they kept us from being inspired by that .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use them to make magic rather than killing .
when i was 16 , i started illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device for storytelling to connect the readers around the world .
it can know how to hold it .
it can know where we are .
it takes pictures and text together , and animation , sound and touch .
storytelling always uses more senses .
but what do we do with it ?
i &apos;m just going to <unk> , an interactive ipad app .
it says , &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s the box : &quot; i write my name .
and i get a character in the book .
and again , a letter goes down for me -- and the ipad knows through gps where i live -- it &apos;s really to me .
the kid in me is really excited about such a possibility .
i talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean magicians and kites , but the magic of childhood , the ideas we had as children .
i always found fireflies in a glass , always exciting .
so here you have to blow the ipad out and clear the fireflies .
and then they light through the back book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can stick in a single marble .
and that &apos;s why every book and every world gets a little marble , which i put into the magic device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
you &apos;ve always had cards cards , but these maps were static .
this map grows and glows and <unk> for orientation in the rest of the book .
it also turns out to be other locations of the book .
i &apos;m going in here .
also , to me , it &apos;s important for me to create something that <unk> is also very paternalistic .
these are the most talkative .
we &apos;ve heard all about <unk> and professionalism , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the <unk> ?
the poor <unk> were caught thousands of years in bosnian chambers , in an old old book .
and we bring them back , in a more contemporary story for children .
it &apos;s a story facing new issues , like the gunshots .
on the subject , a big problem for the last 10 years is that children are sitting in their rooms , in their computers , without out .
but now with mobile technology , we can take our kids to the natural world with their technology .
in an interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search , you have to go out and collect the camera of the ipads images of natural objects .
when i was a kid , i had the collections of <unk> , rocks and tablets and mussels .
these kids don &apos;t do any more .
this is called inertia . you have to go out and make a picture of a flower and tag a picture .
in another chapter you have to hook up a piece of glass tree and tag .
and so you can actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can put online .
a child in london shows the picture of a gradient and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox today . &quot;
a kid in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey today . &quot;
it creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of ways of making magic , the world and technology together .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning an interaction where you &apos;re using the video of the ipads , and you can see , through augmented reality , an animation of peers looking at a plant in front of the house .
at one point , the screen tops with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the <unk> , blow it away and read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the forces of technology can come closer and in magic and technology can arise .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our kids closer to the natural world and our magic , fun and love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is actually an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time living with people in <unk> , prisons or <unk> .
i spend most of my time with the social conviction in the realm and places where there are a lot of hopelessness .
being here at ted , seeing and hearing how stimulated that is , has given me a lot of power .
in the short days of this , i was clear : ted has an identity .
you can say things that have influence around the world .
and sometimes when something comes about ted , it makes a meaning and strength that otherwise has not .
i say that because i believe identity is very important .
we saw some amazing presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher &apos;s words are very meaningful , but that are the words of a driven teaching brilliant teaching .
you can do good things as a doctor , but a doctor &apos;s doctor can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t have to learn this as a lawyer in my work , by the way .
i learned this from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional african-american household dominated by the matriarch , and the matriarch was my grandmother .
she was a tough , powerful woman , she had influence .
she had the last word in every unit .
she was also the origin of a lot of venues in our family .
she was the daughter of a czar .
their parents were born in the safari forests in virginia when slaves were born .
it was born around 1880 , and it shaped their experience of slavery very strongly .
my grandmother was very strong , but she was also loving .
when i met her as a young boy , she came up and handed me up .
she got me so stuck that i could barely breathe , then she let me go .
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came up to me and she said , &quot; do you feel my hug ? &quot;
and if i said no , hug me . if i said &quot; yes , &quot; she told me .
and it was something that made you always wanting to be near you .
the only problem with them was she had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of their 10 children .
sometimes if i had time to spend time with her , it was hard to get her attention .
my cousins are all around us .
i remember , i &apos;ve got to have eight or nine , that i woke up one morning and went to the living room . all my cousins were around .
my grandmother was at the end of the room and staring at me .
at first i thought that was a game .
i looked at them and smiles , but she looked very serious .
this went on for 15 or 20 minutes , and she stood up , and she came over to me . she took me at hand , and she said , &quot; come on . you and i must talk . &quot;
i remember that it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget .
she took me out , and she said , &quot; whoa , i &apos;ll tell you something , but you have to promise you &apos;re not going to pass it . &quot;
i said , &quot; i promised , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down , and she looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i was watching you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she then said , &quot; you just have to promise me three things . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay , granny . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , that you will always love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you have to agree with promise you &apos;re going to take care of them . &quot;
i admired my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , granny , i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; next time you will always do the right thing , &quot; &quot; even if it falls hard to do the right thing . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; yes , granny . i promise it . &quot;
and finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise to me is , &quot; you &apos;re never going to drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yes , granny . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up in the country , in the old , rural south and i have a brother who &apos;s older and a year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this terrified beer with my sister and my sister and i went to the forest .
we just live around there as well .
then he took a drink of beer and offered my sister &apos;s sister , and she assumed , and then she offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . all right . just do it . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do it . now we &apos;re going to do it , you &apos;re doing everything we do .
i had what , your sister had a beer . come a beer .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want it . just do it . just do it . &quot;
my brother was staring at me .
he said , &quot; well , what &apos;s wrong with you ? well , well , guess what ? &quot;
and then he looked at me and said , &quot; oh no , you still don &apos;t make you crazy about the conversation with granny ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma tells everybody a shame they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;ll tell you something .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
this is perhaps going to translate public .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i doubt i &apos;ve never drank a drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s virtuous . i say that &apos;s because identity is power .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell people around us things that they first don &apos;t believe .
we can get them to do things they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would tell all their grandchildren ; they were something special .
my grandfather was in the prison prison during the prison prison .
my uncle died of <unk> diseases .
and she believed that these were the issues that we needed to take care of .
i was trying to say something about our consumer behavior .
this land is different than 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300,000 people were in custody and in prison .
today there are 2.3 million .
the united states today has the highest population division in the world .
seven million people are discharged or targeted <unk> .
in my view , our world has altered fundamentally .
in social and black parts of the population , there are despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one out of three male black black , between 18 and 30 , is in prison , in jail , release or targeted grazing .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles across philadelphia , oxford to washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all the black young men are either in prison , in prison , release or targeted grazing .
but our system is not only going to be shaped by questions that have to do with difficulty , and it &apos;s filtered by poverty as well .
we have a country that is much better at treating them when they &apos;re rich and guilty than poor and guilty .
assets , not transportation , affect the outcome .
but we seem to be totally pleased with that .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we &apos;ve lost touch .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
and there are some anecdotal developments .
my home state in my state will continuously dine for you when you &apos;re prosecuted .
here and today in alabama , 34 percent of the male black population permanently lost the vote .
we predict that in 10 years , the percentage rate of civic engagement is going to be as high as the onset of the killing .
the silence is observer-relative .
i have children .
a lot of my clients are very young .
the united states of america is the only country in the world to beat <unk> children to death in prison .
in this country , there are times signal for children without any form of disability .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of technology .
the only country in the world .
i have people in <unk> .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
we believe that because we taught us that the real question is : did a man deserve to die for one of him dying crimes ?
it &apos;s a very sensitive question .
but you can think also differently depending on how we see our identity .
the other point is not : did anybody deserve death for a crime , but , did we deserve to kill ?
i find that fascinating .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
now , on nine people who have executed , one that we have , for innocent , became <unk> and out of death row .
an amazing ted experience . one of nine innocent .
i find that fascinating .
we would never let anyone fly on an airplane , if for nine planes , take off , crash .
but somehow we can get away from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i talk about race and the question of whether we &apos;re right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i interviewed my students african history . i talk about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time against the reconstruction of the reconstruction , until the beginning of world war ii .
we don &apos;t really know very much about this .
but for the african-american folks in this country , it was a time of terror .
people have had to fear fear in many places .
or about bombs .
it was fear of terror , which shaped your life .
now , these older people are coming up to me and say , &quot; mr , psychiatry , you &apos;re talking , you &apos;re talking , you &apos;re telling people to stop saying that we have to stop doing it in the history of our nation , after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no , tell people we grew up with this . &quot;
and after terrorism , of course , the <unk> and decades of <unk> motivated surrender and apartheid .
and yet in our country , there is a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what meaning our actions are in the historical context .
we run all the time together .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflict .
we have a hard time talking about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa people have understood that the somali is not getting over , not the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there was this willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve kept some talks in germany over the death penalty .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing to hear you talk so much .
he said , &quot; there &apos;s no death penalty in germany .
and of course , in germany it can never give you . &quot;
it got completely quiet . and then a woman said , &quot; our history is impossible that we &apos;re ever going to be talking to the systematic killing of people .
it would be great from us , consciously and specific to people .
i thought about it .
as it would feel , to live in a world where german people had failed people , especially if many jews had had a lot of the jews .
it would be intolerable .
it would be sweet .
and yet , here in this country , in the united states , in the united states , we &apos;re focusing on people -- there &apos;s risk for death to death , 11 times higher , when the victim is white , as if the black is black and the victim knows -- in the same states where the world is black and the victim knows -- in the same states where the body is affecting people .
and yet there &apos;s this mental disconnection .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with these difficult issues , then the positive and wonderful things are affected as well .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but ultimately , these realities are being kept of suffering , abuse , hamsters , apartheid .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
because we finally talk about that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment , to be in a complex world .
for me , it &apos;s time to raise thinking and to talk about the poor , the disadvantaged , those who will never be at ted .
but think in ways that are embedded in our own lives .
we all need to believe in the end of the things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . as rational as we are , we estimate so much .
innovation , creativity , and development are not just coming from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by conviction in our hearts .
it &apos;s this kind of dna that i believe is driving us , not just being open for all the bright and <unk> things , but also for the dark and <unk> .
vaclav <unk> , the great <unk> politician , once said that .
&quot; when we were fighting against oppression in eastern europe , we wanted to do all kinds of things , but what we needed the most was hope , a mental orientation , the willingness to sometimes be in wiser places and witness . &quot;
and this mental orientation is the core of what i think is also the need to get involved in it .
there is no range of technology and design that allows us to be fully human , as long as we don &apos;t have our eyes and ears for poverty , hunting and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity challenges a lot more of us than if we didn &apos;t care about it .
it &apos;s going to be deeply touching .
as a young lawyer , i encouraged the great privilege to meet rosa parks .
and this is a woman who always came back to <unk> , where she gave two of their oldest friends , the elderly women , who &apos;d organized the <unk> -- an incredible <unk> -- and virginia <unk> , a white , whose husband , sociology <unk> , dr. king <unk> .
so these women were meeting and they were just talking .
and then , occasionally , a woman called me and said , &quot; whoa , ms. parks comes to the city . we want to talk .
do you want to meet up and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , very much . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do if you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;ll listen . &quot;
and i went over and just listened .
it was always so inspiring , so evocative .
and then one day i was sitting there listening to these women , and after a few hours , ms. parks turned to me and said , &quot; well , look , tell me what the initiative is at the same time .
what are they trying to do ? &quot;
i started my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go through injustice .
health decisions want to help people who have been innocent .
we want to fight the biases and discrimination in the cafeterias .
we want to abolish brain delight without any form of child abuse .
we want something against the death penalty company .
we want to cut the number of death down .
we want pennies . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and after that , she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> . &quot;
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make you very , very tired . &quot;
then , woman admitted to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; that &apos;s why you have to be very , very excelling . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be <unk> .
we need to make ways of globalizing down to these challenges : these problems , this suffering .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our humanity , from our all humanity .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
i learned a couple of very simple things .
that we are all more , as the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i believe that &apos;s true for every human being on the planet .
when somebody is lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t , he &apos;s not just a thief .
you kill somebody who kills you isn &apos;t just a killer .
and because of that , there is a basic human dignity to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the world , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think so .
i believe in many places the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i think , although it &apos;s so dramatically so beautiful and inspiring , and so stimulating , we won &apos;t be measured at the end of our technology , not the things we develop , not on our intellect and minds .
after all , a society is not going to measured how they manage their rich and powerful and privileged , but how they deal with the poor , the convicted , the <unk> .
because first of all , we &apos;re starting to grasp the truly amazing things that make up .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . a story to end .
sometimes i push too much .
i &apos;m going to get tired , like all of us .
sometimes these ideas advance our thinking , in a very important way .
i represent these kids who have been sentenced to very hard punishment .
i go to the ministry of afghanistan and visit a client that may be 13 or 14 years old , which is supposed to be an adult trial .
then i wonder , how could this happen ?
how can a judge turn somebody into something that he &apos;s not ?
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
one night , i got up too long , and i thought , oh my god , if a judge can transform us into something else , then he must have <unk> .
right , <unk> , the judge has shrunk .
you should want which one wants .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think of it properly , i started to work on one .
i had a happy , poor black boy as clients .
and i started that proposed . the headline said , &quot; proposed to my poor , <unk> black clients like a privileged , white , <unk> <unk> . <unk> .
in my closing assignment , i explained that misconduct could be in addition to the <unk> and the police as well as the police .
there was a crazy line that there is nothing more just in this country that there &apos;s only misconduct in this country .
the next morning i woke up and i couldn &apos;t see if i dreamed of this insane statement or actually written it .
and i had not only written it in the court , but also sent to the court .
a few months went , and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i &apos;ve got to go to the court and tell you this crazy case .
i went into the car , and it was really , really overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that was so difficult , so painful .
eventually , i got out of my car and went up to the court .
when i got the staircase to the court , there was an elderly black man who got janitors in the court .
and when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and gave me a hug .
then he whispered into me .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to say , it made me strength .
it touched something deeply deeply inside me , identity , the ability to contribute to one community , to a community in hope .
well , i went into the courtroom .
as soon as the judge saw me , i saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. stevenson , did you put this crazy proposition ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
more and more people would come in , just because they were angry .
i &apos;d written these crazy things .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and office workers .
in the classroom , the deterioration of people who were angry was that we talked about skin language , about poverty , about inequality .
from my point of view , i watched the janitors go and down .
he kept looking through the window , and he could hear the whole <unk> .
he went up and down .
after all , this older black man came to the courtroom , and he sat right behind me , almost on the top of the kitchen .
ten minutes later the judge quit a break .
and during the break , a camp came in and turned out that the janitors was in the downfall .
this yoyo ran over to the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what are you doing ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he looked at the <unk> , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here to tell this young man , don &apos;t lose the destination . don &apos;t give up . &quot;
i &apos;ve come to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far <unk> , but that it was the justice of justice .
that we are not fully designed as humans , unless we take care of human rights and human rights .
that our all of our survival are connected to survival .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and design , of entertainment , creativity , with humanity , mercy and justice .
and most of all , i want to just say those of you who are just saying , don &apos;t lose the destination . don &apos;t give up .
you &apos;ve seen an obvious desire in this audience , and you &apos;ve seen an obvious desire to help and to do something .
what else can we do ?
<unk> stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
if you &apos;re living in california , there &apos;s a precedent in that spring where it &apos;s actually about setting up a effort , some of the <unk> , that &apos;s going to go into the politics of punishment .
for example , in california , in the next five years , a billion dollars for the death penalty will be one billion dollars .
and yet , 46 percent of all the workforce not with a conviction .
56 percent of all expenses are not in trial .
there &apos;s a chance to do something .
this desire will propose to invest in more security and security .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
over the past three decades , the u.s. epidemic has declined tremendously .
that the fact is often put in a context with the elevated employees .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
now , in fact , the death of violence has not changed very much .
most of the food consumption in this country didn &apos;t actually find in the class of violent illness .
it was the u.s. sales helmet against drugs .
that &apos;s why the dramatic levels come in high prisoners .
we went from the rhetoric of punishment .
now we have &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , which bring people behind the bars , for a <unk> , for the theft good , rather than that they forces to give back the sacrifice .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become victims of crimes , not less .
and i think our current reality is helping nobody present .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
yeah , you really have a string of popularity here .
they are inspirational personality .
thank you for coming to ted . thank you .
by bin laden , bin laden is an increased radiation .
famine in somalia : famine in somalia : mandarin spray of the police .
speaker 4 : malignant <unk> . born five : dangerous luck .
read 6 : global deterioration . at 12,000 : 65 dead .
speaker 8 : ooh . 9 / 7
different speakers : <unk> of mass destruction . tornado .
recession . gridlock . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just some of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- it could have been the last six days , or the last six years .
in fact , the media prefer to show us negative subjects because our minds are getting attention to these issues .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for this too .
every second each second , our senses can catch much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because nothing more important is than our survival , the first subway station for all the information is part of our temporal lobes , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our early detection team , our transportation team .
it hypothesized , and it <unk> all the information in looking for any notion of danger in our environment .
so when we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old adage , &quot; when it rains , demand is very true . &quot;
now , with all of our digital devices that will take us seven days a week , 24 days a day , all these negative messages , it &apos;s no wonder that we &apos;re pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle everybody thinks that the world is always worse .
but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
it may dramatically accelerate the enormous progress that we &apos;ve made in a series of forces , so strong that in the next three decades we will be able to create a world of excess .
now , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , energy systems , water and energy systems -- we have that .
and as human beings , we &apos;re much better at anticipating problems at a very long time , but ultimately , to overcome them .
now , let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so that we can anticipate the development .
over the last hundred years , average life expectancy has tripled more than doubled , which has tripled inflation .
child mortality has dropped by a tenth .
and what happens is that the food diet , the hydrogen diet , and communication costs , will have a double decrease .
steve pinker has shown us that we are living at the moment in a very peaceful time of life .
and according to charles potts , we have gone from 25 percent to 80 percent over the past 130 years .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we continue to increase our expectations .
in fact , we redefined poverty .
now think that a great percentage of americans who live under poverty poverty have access to electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , television , cellphones and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , earth &apos;s richest , could never have dreamed of such materials .
the basis for a lot of these forms technologies , and they grow growth systems .
so my good friend friend kurzweil has shown us that any tool that is going to become information technology on the curve of moore &apos;s law takes large jumps , and each of them doubled every 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone in your pocket costs about a million times less , and it &apos;s a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
that &apos;s moore &apos;s law of the last hundred years .
notice two things at this curve .
first of all , how smooth it -- in good times , war or peace , recession , depression and <unk> .
this is the result of faster computers building faster computers .
it slowed down for none of our big problems .
also , despite your logarithmic pierce on the left , it &apos;s up .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to all of us .
<unk> , something that my friends in autodesk call &quot; <unk> , &quot; sensors and networks , robots , that allow my friends to democratize the personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , fuel , vaccination and food , digital medicine and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the victory of ross supercomputers watson at risk ?
that was great .
i was looking at newspapers and looking for the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson <unk> human enemy . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence would have provided every given owner .
four years ago , ray kurzweil launched , and i &apos;m here at ted a new university called singularity university .
we bring our students all these technologies , and specifically focus on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students to create companies , companies , product services , within a decade that will affect the lives of billions of people .
think about a group of students today can impact the lives of billions of people .
thirty years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
now we can refer to dozens of companies who did exactly that .
when i think of creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of opportunities .
it &apos;s about creating extended goods .
but scarcity is <unk> , and technology is a natural liberating force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of napoleon <unk> in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he was invited the king of <unk> to dinner .
<unk> soldiers had received <unk> , mastery itself .
but the king of <unk> was getting <unk> .
aluminum , at that time , was the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable and platinum .
this is why the dome is made from aluminum .
even though aluminum is one percent of the wind percent , it &apos;s not a pure metal .
it &apos;s being connected by oxygen and plastic .
but then the technology of industrial technology was developed , and so cheap , we used to use it with our online culture .
and then let &apos;s project this analogy into the future .
we think of ourselves today .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet that is more powerful than we use every year .
16 clean energy energy serves all 88 minutes to the earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is free .
and there &apos;s good news .
this year , you &apos;ve been able to reduce the cost of solar power in india to 50 percent of the gdp -- <unk> rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar power was 50 percent in the last year .
last month , this has published with a study that shows that up to the end of this decade , we have six cents per gallon , compared to 15 cents a gallon , compared to 15 cents at national average .
and if we have a <unk> , we will also have water in the abundance .
talk about hydrogen efficiency .
remember , carl sagan , in 1990 , when it was on saturn , turned back to the earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how was it written ?
&quot; a blue blue devil . &quot;
because we &apos;re living on a planet .
we live on a planet that &apos;s 70 percent covered with water .
yes , it &apos;s 50 percent saltwater , two percent are <unk> , and we &apos;re fighting to be 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the road , <unk> .
and from a conversation this morning with dean ornish , who &apos;s one of the innovators of the do it , i want to share with you -- he gave me the permission -- his <unk> , called &quot; <unk> , &quot; which many of you may have heard about . it &apos;s the size of a woodpecker in the headlights .
it can generate a thousand gallons of clean drinking water a day from different sources -- whether frozen , polluted water , latrine -- and all that for less than two cents a gallon .
the chairman of coca-cola has just begun to start a big deal with a hundred units in the developing world .
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola will apply this technology globally in low-carbon countries around the planet .
this is airstrip innovation that we have today .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
oh my goodness , we are entering the 70 percent of mobile phones in developing countries to the end of 2013 .
and just remember that having a mobile phone with a cell phone in the middle of kenya has a better health meal than president reagan was 25 years ago .
and if you search with your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information than president clinton was 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has resisted information and communication , as no one could have predicted .
and it &apos;s getting better , the things that you and i have spent tens of thousands of dollars -- gps , <unk> and photo , libraries of books and music , technology for medical diagnostics -- are now literally <unk> and cheaper in your cell phone .
and the best part of this is possibly what &apos;s expected to us in health .
i had the pleasure last month , with the design method called &quot; $ 10 million <unk> x prize . &quot;
we demand teams all over the world to connect all these technologies together in a mobile phone , that you can talk to the device , because it is equipped with artificial intelligence , you can test <unk> or your <unk> .
and to win , the device needs a better diagnosis than a team of <unk> doctors .
imagine this device , in the middle of a developing country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the world &apos;s top and 1.3 percent of healthcare .
now , when this device sequenced a <unk> or <unk> , which is not known , it calls the concession center and prevents a pandemic before your outbreak .
but now the biggest force that will lead us to a world of excess .
i call it &quot; the next billion . &quot;
the white lines are population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the travel chain .
and by the way , the biggest security agency against a population explosion is a better education and diet around the world .
in 2010 , we now had under two billion people online .
by 2020 , we &apos;re going to run two to five billion users users .
three billion new minds that we &apos;ve never heard before will join global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are you going to consume ? what will you want ?
and instead of economic gridlock , i see one of the greatest economic disassemblers in history .
these people represent several trillion dollars to flow into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be healthier by using the cost of being healthier , and they &apos;re going to be trained as the opportunity to use 3d printers , and by using the ability to use 3d printers and <unk> computing , and be more productive than ever before .
so what can we bring about three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the world revolution ?
how about a set of new , never <unk> voices .
what about the oppressed , wherever they are , give a voice to pay attention to , to create change , for the first time ?
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
what about surveys we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned from the x prize is that small teams that motivated through passion and focus can create extraordinary things , things that could create large companies and governments only in the past .
i want to close with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some might have already known .
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein will evolve .
according to its behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in the high-tech world .
it was a problem for supercomputers so far .
and this game was played by university professors and so on .
and there are now hundreds of thousands of people playing the game online now .
and it showed that nowadays the human pattern is better than the best supercomputers .
and when these people came and watched who was the best person in the world , it was not a <unk> , and it was a man from england , manchester , a woman who worked at the day as a assistant for the approval and was the best in the world .
ladies and gentlemen , which have enormous faith in our future , is the fact that we have more power than individuals today to make us the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a gradient .
we have the capital capital capital .
and we have three billion new minds with whom we can work online to master the new challenges and to do what &apos;s necessary .
so we expect some extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to do something about a paralyzing piece of medical culture .
and i think that with the medical physician , it begins .
and maybe i &apos;ve been in the business for a long time , as that i can allow myself to give up a piece of my own misconceptions in order to make this possible .
but before i come to the actual theme of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we are close to the world &apos;s office and moving to the world cup .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of neat statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; appears soon and turns around statistics and to make a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to refer to a statistic that i hope most of you have heard about .
it &apos;s the oscilloscope of the consortium .
we &apos;re talking about 300 when a bat beat 300 .
that means that the player will probably beat 3 beats .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on the ball , it &apos;s coming up , it &apos;s not going to get caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball on the first base , it didn &apos;t get done in time and the emperor was safe .
three out of 10 .
do you know how to call a <unk> in major league baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a <unk> .
do you know how to call a <unk> ?
this is somebody dropping four out of 10 in the rest of the day .
<unk> -- like ted williams <unk> -- the last major league baseball player performing during 400 times over a season season .
let &apos;s turn back to my world of medicine , where i feel much more comfortable , or maybe a little less likely i &apos;ve talked to you about it .
suppose you &apos;ve transferred a <unk> , and you lowered it into a <unk> , which is its <unk> 400 in terms of <unk> .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine if you &apos;re living in a certain area , and you &apos;ve got a beloved person with clogged homes , and you &apos;ve got a very beloved one of these clogged people , whose health care levels are 200 at 200 .
but , but you know what ?
it &apos;s much better this year . it &apos;s in a rising branch .
and she &apos;s beating a sedan .
it doesn &apos;t work somehow .
but i &apos;ll ask you a question .
what do you think they like for a bribe or a nurse or a nurse or a <unk> , a <unk> , should be a fighter ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that nobody in all medicine knows what a good surgeon or a doctor or a doctor &apos;s supposed to be .
what we do , though , is that all of us , including me , are locked out in the world with the claim to be perfect .
never make any mistake , but nobody cares about the details of how to do that .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
i was an obsessive <unk> student .
in high school , a school report once told that brian <unk> would learn for a blood test .
and it was .
and i learned in my little 14 hours in the sisters at toronto , general hospital , not so , from here .
i memorized everything .
in my inbox , i learned the origins and the tail of every blanket , every branch of every artery that is made by your aorta , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i even knew the <unk> to classify <unk> <unk> .
and all the time , i was getting more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i finished with <unk> <unk> .
and i left medical school with the impression that , if i memorized everything and knew everything , or at least as much as possible , as much as possible , that i was immune to mistakes .
and it worked for a while , until i met a storyteller .
i met a hospital hospital here in toronto as a woman , who was brought to me for the president of the hospital .
at that point i was appointed the hayden stadium at the pittsburgh service .
and it was my assignment when i was looking at <unk> &apos;s attention , looking at the <unk> .
and we put feedback on my main tool .
i studied ms. printers , and she was in <unk> .
and when i tune it , she made strangely sounds .
and i was able to hear my chest on both sides , and i was able to hear a <unk> sound on both sides , which told me that she was suffering with <unk> heart failure .
this is a state in which the heart fails , instead of pumping all of the blood , put a part of the blood inside in the lung and slowly filling it up , which is why the <unk> came .
and this was not a <unk> diagnosis .
i hired her and gave me the care .
i took her stamps . i gave her medicine to take the heart of the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call <unk> , water pills , so that they blow the liquid .
and over one and a half to two hours , they started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i had my first mistake ; i sent them home .
actually , i did two mistakes .
i sent them home without my companion .
i didn &apos;t take up on the list and do what i was supposed to have , which was a call in my inbox to put it with him , so that he had an opportunity to have a picture .
and he knew that he would have been able to add additional information to her back .
maybe i did some good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the smartest doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so capable of taking responsibility , that i was like that , and so i would be able to make sure of my patients without having to contact it .
my second mistake was worse .
and by sending them home , i had a quiet voice in me , who was trying to say , &quot; goldman , not a good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in fact , it was so much <unk> that i asked the nurse that i asked the nurse about , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and the nurse said , &quot; yeah , i think it will go well . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
so i scraped the <unk> and an ambulance and tape team came in and took them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , the night i had this nagging feeling in my stomach .
but i kept working .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , descend the hospital , and went to the parking room to go home with the car when i did something else .
i went back to my way home .
and there was another nurse that said , not the sister who had seen the after the woman , but another three words to me , and those three words fear most of whom i know .
other professionals are also afraid of these , but critical care is especially because we see the patients just so fleeting .
three words : remember , remember ?
&quot; remember the patient they sent home ? &quot;
asked the nurse questions .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular anglerfish .
so she was back .
she was back and she was dying .
about an hour after she got to home , after she &apos;d sent her home , she would collapse , and the family called 911 , and the <unk> , they took them back on top of the kitchen pressure with a $ 50 blood pressure , which is dangerous , dangerous .
she barely breathed , and was blue <unk> .
the <unk> lost all the strands .
they gave her credit rating .
and they banded at the clinic .
i was shocked and down to the inner river .
and i went through this rollercoaster because it came to the intensive care unit , and i hoped it would recover .
and after two , three days realized she would never ring again .
she didn &apos;t have a <unk> <unk> suffered .
their family got together .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they were evolving .
on the day day of sculpture , they made them go -- woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
it &apos;s said that you never forget the names of those who never forget .
and this was the first time i learned this myself .
the next week i gave guidance , and i found myself for the first time , the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone , isolated , not the kind of healthy shame you felt , because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
you know all of the healthy shame , if you give a secret to the best friend of your best friend , even though you put it on a <unk> and you get your best friend and you have a terrible discussion , when you end up with a terrible discussion , and you submit that you never make a mistake like that again .
and you can never make the mistake and make the mistake again .
that &apos;s the kind of superman shame .
the unhealthy way i talk about is the one that makes you a heart valve .
it &apos;s the one who says you &apos;re not doing something bad , but you &apos;re bad for yourself .
and that &apos;s what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my boss . he was very pleased .
he talked to the family , and i &apos;m sure he pulled down the waves and convinced that i was not sued .
but i asked myself these questions .
why did i not ask the track card ? why would i send them home ?
and then in my worst moments : how could i make a dumb mistake ?
why did i go into medicine ?
slowly , but surely it took .
i started feeling better .
and then on a <unk> day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke out , and i might say , maybe i can feel better again .
and i was with that , if i doubled the perfection of perfection and never made a mistake , that the voice could be crushed .
and she did .
and i kept working .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had a service at the local hospital in a local hospital hospital in northern toronto , and i hosted a 25 year-old man with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot of work , and i was in a hurry .
he was always showing up here .
and i looked at the <unk> , and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on .
and even when he went out the door he showed up on his grandmother-in-law .
two days later , i came to my nearest ted wish , and my foster colleagues asked me to talk to her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; remember the patient with the <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
it turns out he &apos;s a <unk> .
he had a potentially known disease called <unk> .
you can google this , but it &apos;s not an infection of salt , it &apos;s the top pressure , and you get the pain &apos;s pain pain .
and fortunately , he did not die .
he got barefoot scrubs and recovered a few days later .
and i went back through the same aspect of pity and self-doubt , felt free , and went back to work until it comes over and over again .
i &apos;ve missed two times in a nanotube for two times .
there &apos;s a lot of stuff to that , especially when you consider that you &apos;re working in a hospital that at that time only had 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there were probably no imperfections in their treatment .
in one case , i thought he was staying around .
i came up with the x-ray of my kidneys , and when this was without evidence , my colleague in the patient &apos;s loveliness posed a <unk> in the lower right sector and called technicians .
the other had strong diarrhea .
i bribed <unk> to graduate him and asked my colleagues to explore as well .
and he did , and when he looked at a <unk> in the right sector , he phoned surgeons .
in both cases , <unk> became <unk> , and they were fine .
both cases of mine , eating me up .
and i &apos;d be happy to tell you that my worst mistake only happened in the first five years , which many of my colleagues say , but total bullshit .
some of my study happened in the last five years .
by itself , obsession and without support .
so here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t close with my errors and talk about them , if i can &apos;t close the quiet voice that tells me what really happened , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them my errors so they don &apos;t commit the same ?
if i had a room -- like now , i have no idea what you &apos;re thinking about me .
when did you hear the last time you heard about somebody who was talking about <unk> about <unk> ?
oh , you go to a cocktail party , and you may hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear anyone talking about your mistakes .
if i had a room full of colleagues , and i would ask for their immediate help and start telling them what i just told you , i would probably not reach the end of the second story before it really awkward you , somebody would have a joke , you would have a joke , you would go and forget the rest .
and in fact , if i knew , or my colleagues , a <unk> in my hospital would have taken the wrong leg , believe me , i had trouble looking in the eyes .
that &apos;s the system that we live in .
it &apos;s totally devoid of errors .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t make any mistakes , those who don &apos;t do the noise of sleep , and those without constraint , which have bad results and those with good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological response like antibodies that attack you .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we relegate those who make mistakes out of medicine , that we have a safe system .
but there are two problems with this .
in my about 20 years of medical science and journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal medical study study about medical error and wrong treatments to do so , so all i could do for my first article , star star , to my show star , is to learn to learn .
and what i learned is that error is absolutely essential .
we &apos;re working in a system where every single day we make errors , which is either a false or wrong one , in which infections are always becoming more and devastation or dead .
in that state , approximately 24,000 canadians die of <unk> mistakes .
in the united states , the institute of medicine issued the number of 100,000 .
they &apos;re both strong <unk> because we don &apos;t see the problem as much as we should .
and is the <unk> .
in a olympics where medical knowledge is doubling every two to three years , we cannot keep up .
sleep deprivation is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive error so that we can take a perfect driver for a patient with chest chest .
and then i take the same patient with <unk> , make it <unk> , and give it a little bit of hot breath , and all of a sudden the story is saturated with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same process .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i &apos;m not always doing things the same .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms in the same way .
all of these are inevitably inevitable .
so , when you take the system , as i &apos;ve been taught , and all the <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s no one left .
and you know the people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , &quot; white <unk> , black art , &quot; i have the habit to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say it &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; i would say it &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; what about her ? &quot; and then i &apos;ll show you the microphone .
and then your pupils expand , you &apos;re in front of your head , and you look down and you &apos;re hard to start telling them stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
you want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes i &apos;m going to make . &quot;
what you need is an environment that enables you to do that .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the newly defined is a human , and it knows about his humanity , accepts them , is not proud of making mistakes , but putting all of them learning from them so that they can be passed on .
it shares your experience with others .
it supports them when others talk to them .
and it shows others their mistakes , not for retirement , but in a skilled , supportive way that they all benefit .
and she works in an medical culture that recognizes that humans fill the system with life , and if that &apos;s like that , people also make mistakes from time to time .
so that the system then evolved to create <unk> , which makes it easier to find out the mistakes that people do , and it also allows caring to create supportive spaces in which everyone who is looking at health care can actually respond to things that make the potential mistakes and even rewarded it , and particularly for people like me , who make mistakes and that reward for the prescription of those .
my name is brian mead .
i totally defined the doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
but i applied process , but i try to learn best possible from giving it to others .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re thinking of me , but i can live with that .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about 5.7 splitting .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;d like to tell you three stories in order to use the time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he was in 1835 .
you might think he blew <unk> , but it &apos;s not .
they actually collected fish .
he described one of them as very &quot; common . &quot;
it was a slugfest .
and it went into big style for the 1980s .
it &apos;s now in the red list of animal animals .
this is a story that we &apos;ve heard many times from the galapagos or elsewhere , it &apos;s not very special .
but we &apos;re still getting into the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the standard people are still describing them untouched .
so what happened here ?
the second story is to create another concept , the most consistent thing , evidence .
because i experienced it when i was studying a lagoon in <unk> .
i went there because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work later in africa .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a bad <unk> , and i was convinced that i was really not from there .
it was my first <unk> <unk> .
as you can see , the lagoon was from palms and by a few mangroves .
there were 4,000 inches of about 20 inches , <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> .
the fisheries of these transfers were very productive , and the fishermen lived well and deserved in ghana above average .
when i got home 27 years later , the fish had shrunk to half its size .
clubs do five centimeters .
they were genetically recyclable .
they were still fishes .
people were still happy .
and the fish also was lucky to be there .
so nothing changed , and yet everything has changed .
my third little story tells me about my favorite story of my favorite introduction in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- in the beginning of the &apos; 60s -- funded europe many pogroms .
<unk> meant the countries that have already 100,000 fish , the industrial fishing of this kind of ugly ship called <unk> 4 .
i went on to do it , and we made bumps all over the southern south east ocean , and particularly in the coalmine .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i now know it was the bottom of the sea .
ninety percent of our plastics were sponges , other animals associated with the cause .
the largest part of the fish , the little dots that there are on the rubble , the <unk> , were <unk> .
basically the bottom of the ocean came , and then it &apos;s back back .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition is going very fast .
within a year you have an elevation , and then you start with the commercial fishing system .
the reason is going to change . in this case , a hard reason or a soft coral will crap .
this is a dead turtle .
they weren &apos;t eaten , they threw them off because they were dead .
once one time we were alive .
she wasn &apos;t drowning yet .
and then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain of calories will have computers every time they go into areas where they have never been worn .
but it &apos;s not going to be documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we fit our new level to the new level and don &apos;t call us what was there .
if you zoom in , this is what happens .
on the y-axis , there are some good things : biodiversity , number of integrations , the green of your country , the <unk> .
over time , it changes . it changes , because for humans , their actions are completely natural .
every generation looks at the images that they are beginning to be in the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard , and they can derive all of that .
the difference is perceived as a loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
there can be a sequence of change .
and finally , you just want to get the <unk> remains of remains .
this is now largely our target .
we want to preserve things that are vanished or things that are not as much as they were .
you might think that the problem came into people who certainly lived when they lived in mature societies , animals , and they first realized what they had done .
because obviously an animal that has been very common , first of all , before it fails .
so you don &apos;t lose a lot of visible animals .
you always lose rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not going to be a loss of loss .
over time , we focus on the large animals and the sea are the big fish .
they &apos;re less likely because we &apos;re catching them .
there &apos;s little fish left over the time , and we think that &apos;s the <unk> .
the question is , why people accept it ?
well , because they don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , many people , scientists , confirm it was really different .
you &apos;re going to confirm it because the evidence of how you shape in some previous form are not the way you like to describe the evidence .
so , for example , there &apos;s the anecdote that the report of a computer &apos;s program took home , which was seen in this area , was not able to be used , or by lack of labor , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in educated societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this is the tremendously big role that a marine reserve can play .
because , through marine-protected areas , we &apos;re basically putting the past back .
we &apos;re bringing back the past that people can &apos;t understand because the policies have changed and are very low .
so with that , the people who are looking at a marine reserve and benefits from the view that allow them to update their perception .
what about the people who aren &apos;t possible , because they don &apos;t have access -- the people in the midwest , for example ?
here , i think art and film might be filling the gap , and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
we were there a long time ago -- 500 years ago .
and the freudian and <unk> might remind you of &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think of &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were being touched this way -- aside from the <unk> , why were they so touched by the <unk> ?
because it &apos;s something that &apos;s lost in some way .
so my recommendation , the only one i &apos;ll give is cameron , to turn it &quot; avatar ii &quot; underwater .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the communist winter system , if you had a typewriter , it would sense for government .
they also had to sense a leaf full of that typewriter .
the reason for that is to track up where the text came from .
and if you thought about it , they could find an article on the father of that thought .
and in the west , we couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do that , and how much that would be dominating the speech of speech .
in our own countries , we would never do that .
but in 2011 today , if you buy a new video station from the leading satellite trees and print one side of it , this side of this side is bright yellow <unk> on every page , in a pattern that clearly pushes on you and your printer .
this is what happens to us today .
and nobody would think about that .
and this was an example , which is how our own governments do the technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the three major sources of existing existing particles .
so let &apos;s look at what really happens in the world : we can divide the attacks in categories .
we have three main approaches .
you have palestine-loves-israel .
for example , this is mr. <unk> <unk> from abuja in ukraine .
and the motives of economics are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use <unk> to make a lot of money , a huge ton of money .
there are several well-known cases that have made their money through attacks .
this is evangelina <unk> from abuja in estonia .
this is alfred <unk> .
stephen watt .
<unk> bellos .
this is matthew anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on .
these people have come online to wealth , but they have acquired it illegal by using for example , for example , to steal money from our bank bank , while we &apos;re doing our online research , or also <unk> that have collected our <unk> in input over the keyboard while we shop over an infected computer online .
the american intelligence agency , two months ago , was the swiss account of mr. sam jain here , and in this account , there was 77 million dollars in it than it was frozen .
mr. jain itself is on a remote foot , the abode is unknown .
and i &apos;ll argue today that we are more likely to be victims of a <unk> than a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going to be even worse .
in the future , most crimes are going to play online .
the second largest challenge we can see today is not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests , or an opinion , or through their audience .
groups like anonymous have moved over the last 12 months , and they have become one of the main plots in the field of <unk> .
so that &apos;s the three main stages : criminals who are doing it because of the money , including social anonymous , who provide resistance , but the final group are nations , governments who run attacks .
that &apos;s where we have cases , like <unk> .
it shows an idea of what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
<unk> is one of the netherlands in the netherlands -- or it was .
last fall , it had to be <unk> , because <unk> had been hacked .
somebody has been hacked and hacked the system .
and last week , in a meeting with dutch government , i asked one of the senior members of the group to be able to figure out if he could have died because of the <unk> people had died .
and his answer was yes .
well , how do people get in touch such depressed ?
<unk> is a collaboration .
they sell <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
well , a board , you need a website with <unk> service , for example , gmail .
now , we all use , or many of us , gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly prevalent in places like iran , where pigs used foreign vendor like gmail , because they know that they can trust more than their local players , and they &apos;re encrypted , so the local government can &apos;t travel in conversation .
but can you yet , if you look in a foreign foreign system , you can do it .
high-end hacking and fake <unk> are posting .
and this is exactly what happens in the case of accident .
what about the arab spring and the things that happened in egypt for example ?
now , in egypt , the insurgency in april , the headquarters of 2011 , the headquarters in the egyptian <unk> , they found a lot of records .
there was a folder in that records called &quot; manifesta . &quot;
and in that folder , the notes of one in germany had sold a few programs that the egyptian government had sold a few programs that they were able to intercept in very big scale -- a lot of communication of egyptian citizens .
they had sold this program for <unk> dollars to the egyptian government .
the converse is right here .
so the western governments , the western governments , are drawn for governments to take care of their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany just a couple of weeks ago , they found something called the <unk> , which was a miracle that had been used by german government for their own citizens .
if you &apos;re in a <unk> , you &apos;re almost certainly alert to your phone .
but we &apos;re way beyond that .
they tap their internet connection .
they use resources like <unk> to <unk> their computer with an ai that allows them to monitor their entire communication , pick out their <unk> , pick up their passwords .
so , if we keep thinking about things like this , the obvious answer to people would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but i don &apos;t care because i &apos;m a good citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry !
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and that argument makes no sense .
you must have privacy .
privacy is not a debate .
it &apos;s not a choice between privacy and safety .
it &apos;s a choice between freedom and control .
and as we now , in 2011 , like our governments trust our trust , it &apos;s every right we leave , forever , to be emitted .
and do we trust , we trust one of the future government , a government we may have in 50 years ?
those are the questions we have to deal with the next 50 years .
it may seem strange to you , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> had been prosecuted and <unk> a simple idea : the modules of cement that fit .
<unk> became very quick the most infected in the world .
they put us in a position to build things bigger than us , buildings , bridges , a rock after the other .
basically , this was a space of time for our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out of this .
it &apos;s called the automatically hawaiian rock .
and within a few years , lego moved into each household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 rocks for every person on the planet .
they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful homes , beautiful bridges , beautiful buildings .
lego made it possible for everybody .
lego basically has the earth building , the building block of the world , and it made a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , the same year at bell labs announced the next revolution , the next building block .
the transistor was a little <unk> that would take us from a world of static , extracting building blocks into a world where everything was interactive .
like the <unk> , the transistor allows us to build much larger , more complex circuits , a rock after the other .
but there &apos;s a mutation : the transistor was only for experts .
i personally accept this not that the building block of our time is reserved for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago i was at the media lab , and i started studying this idea of how to put the power of engineers in artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing airplanes .
let me show you how they work .
there are electronic modules that have a specific function .
they &apos;re crinoids , light , sound , motor and sensor .
and the best part is they connect up with magnets .
you can &apos;t put them together the wrong way .
the stones are observer-relative .
green is output , blue is power , pink is input and orange is cables .
so , all you have to do is connect a blue one and a green one , and they can build much larger , really , very quickly .
they put a blue one on one green , and they can make light .
and they can put a switch in between , and they &apos;ve created a little bit of ink .
you go out the switch and you put it in there , you have a little <unk> , and you &apos;ve made a little <unk> .
put this extra thing on for a more precious effect , and you &apos;ve made a design engine .
i will stop that .
learning about the simple play is actually pretty powerful .
instead of having to program , whether you have to program or whether you have to program , to code with simple intuitive gestures .
so to speed up the flashing or slow it down , just turn on this button , and it makes the momentum faster or slower .
the idea behind it is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction in the world into a <unk> stone .
lights , sound , ring , engines -- everything should be available .
we have children spread out of children and seeing them with it .
and it was an amazing experience .
the most beautiful is how they start to understand the electronics that they &apos;re in everyday life , and they don &apos;t learn in school .
like , for example , a piece of rules works , or why the doors of the <unk> <unk> , or how an ipod responds .
we also have <unk> into field schools .
so we had , for example , designers with no experience in electronic things that started playing with materials as material .
we can see here , with puppies and paper and water bottles ...
a few weeks ago , we went to risd and gave them some designers who had no technical experience -- just cardboard , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; do something . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , which is a <unk> machine .
but wait , this is really my business story here .
it &apos;s a hummer of play-doh , which is fear in darkness .
for this <unk> , another material , electronics became one more material .
and we want to make this material available to everyone .
so solar source is open source .
